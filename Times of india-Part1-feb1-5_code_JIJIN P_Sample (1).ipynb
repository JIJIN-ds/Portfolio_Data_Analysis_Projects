       "['Intolerance of various kinds is on the rise all around us, online and offline. From mere bullying to taking someone’s life for the silliest of reasons, it takes many shapes and forms and Kerala isn’t an exception. Often, the easily quoted solution for this is that one should ‘teach kids to behave’ right from a young age, at homes. I’m not saying we can forget the family’s role in the process, but it’s at schools that they spent the maximum amount of time. Are there effective mechanisms in our curriculum today which teach kids to be humane citizens?Every school time table has an hour dedicated for moral science in which children are supposed to be imparted ethics, values and life lessons. But the period isn’t given the same importance as physics, math or chemistry, and often ends up being a namesake. I spoke to Anita Krishnan, a senior faculty member of Holy Angels ISC School, Thiruvananthapuram, who agrees that we need to take up the subject seriously. “Education’s primary aim should be to create good human beings, not just scholars. I would say that going forward, schools should strictly implement steps to impart a value-based education system to the young generation. We should make it a compulsory subject in the curriculum, and the stress should be on teaching children to respect differences of opinion, which is the need of the hour,” she says.S Jaishree, faculty at MOP Vaishnav College for Women in Chennai, is of the opinion that moral education classes at schools can be made a lot more interesting using videos, animation and practical exercises. “We can make value education classes part of the credit system in colleges too. Students can be asked to share their experiences of demonstrating the importance of values in their lives. It will motivate others,” she says.At the same time, teachers say that one should demonstrate the values taught at school. Jaishree says, “For example, we can teach them to be kind to others but that needs to be demonstrated in real life too, by the elders. There are more chances of the children imbibing it, for real.”Most of all, it is important to ensure that moral science is not just a subject to score marks or credits, she says. It sure is not easy, but if schools genuinely try to see the bigger picture and take some novel steps, our future generations can be taught to see the black, white and grey sides in people and incidents around us.',\n",
       " 'By \\'Abhishek.Shukla2@timesgroup.comActors Yashpal Sharma, Mir Sarwar and actress Mita Vashisht, recently shot for a Holi song at Kudiya Ghat for the film \\'Mr Paanwala\\'. Due to the dense fog, the shooting was delayed by a few hours but as the sun came out around noon, it brightened up the faces of the crew members.The song sequence also had many local artists performing who were seen practising the dance steps while shooting was halted.Telling us more about the song, Hum Ka Khila De Ek Paan Banarasi, Vijay Bhola, the producer and director of the film said, \"This energetic festival song is sung by Vishal Dadlani and has been composed by Jazim Sharma, who has also composed all the songs in the film. Music is an integral part of this film and I am sure everyone is going to love the music as singers like Arijit Singh, Vishal Dadlani, Rahat Fateh Ali Khan, Shreya Ghosal and many others have been roped in to sing for several songs in the movie.\" The film is set on the backdrop of Lucknow, where Yashpal plays a Lakhnavi paanwala while Mita plays his wife.',\n",
       " 'Recently, Mrinalini Ravi, who shot to fame with her dubsmash videos, took to her social media page to announce that she’s part of Thiagarajan Kumararaja’s Super Deluxe. She posted, “A Thiagarajan kumararaja Film #superdeluxe” (sic) and put up a picture with the team.Ask her how she got the offer and Mrinalini says, “One of Kumararaja sir’s assistants had called me for a screen test. I was obviously both excited and nervous. But I was keen on giving it my best, irrespective of the outcome. I was given a narration of the role, and I later gave a look test and mouthed a few dialogues. Though I gave it my best, I didn’t have any expectations. But a few days later, the team called me to say that I fit the role perfectly.”Though she’s not allowed to reveal any details, Mrinalini tells us that her role is quite interesting. “It is not your run-of-the-mill roles. This one is super interesting,” she smiles.Mrinalini clarifies that she doesn’t share screen space with Vijay Sethupathi or Samantha in the film. She adds, “My portions were shot in Chennai. I had a great experience learning from Thiagarajan sir. He is an amazing director. He is a perfectionist and had everything organised. He knows what he wants from the artiste. He’s particular about timings. Working with him has only made me punctual and dedicated towards my work.”Apart from Super Deluxe, Mrinalini also has debutant Suresh Kumar’s film in the pipeline. “Super Deluxe is most likely to hit the screens first,” she says, adding, “As of now, I am balancing my job at an IT firm and movies. My company has been kind enough to give me leaves. But if I begin to get a lot of offers from the industry, I will have to become very organised and plan my schedule well.”',\n",
       " 'Why are diesel prices almost as high as petrol these days?Since all passenger and freight vehicles run on diesel, its price was always regulated. However, petrol is more environment friendly than diesel and so cess has been made higher on diesel now. We were able to get diesel at a lower price earlier because we were not so conscious of the environment. Also, high-end diesel cars started hitting the market, beating the purpose of the diesel subsidy. Big car manufacturers started getting these benefits.Was it a good move on the government’s part to hand over the decision of pricing of fuel to oil companies?It was around 2002 that it started becoming an international trend to privatise everything, as part of globalisation. All our necessities which were in public sector started getting privatised. At the same time, the number of vehicles on the road increased unprecedentedly and the oil pool account (formed in 1972 to regulate the prices of oil globally) started becoming a burden for the Centre’s budget. That was why the Vajpayee government decided to leave the determination of oil prices to the market, in 2002.They hike fuel prices claiming rise in crude oil prices. But are they misusing this?I would say go to the website of the petroleum department and check the real figures. Figures in WhatsApp forwards and untrustworthy news websites can be misleading. As of January 17, crude oil price in the international market is `26.13. If the price of petrol is `70 or `80, the rest is all central and state government taxes plus the oil marketing companies’ share. Also, for every litre of diesel or petrol, the pump gets `3.59 as commission.If it goes on like this, won’t petrol prices hit `100 soon? What would the future be?It all depends on the government. Gulf countries reduced the availability of oil, which is a reason why the prices have hiked. It might go up again but at one point, there will be international pressure to lower it. But in India, it will also depend on government policies. It might go upto `90 or `100 and then come down by the next elections.Ranjith’s last wordFrom the economist’s point of view, these are convincing but some questions remain unanswered still which the governments should answer. Why are the governments imposing such a high amount of taxes? The reasoning about the diesel subsidy is very clear but can’t another system be devised wherein public transport and freight traffic be given the subsidy but not the others? Why should 95% of the population suffer a lack of subsidy for the sake of 5%?',\n",
       " 'A National School of Drama alumnus who taught acting in Mumbai, Udupi lad Yashwanth Shetty has steadily been making inroads in Kannada cinema since his breakthrough role in Jwalantham. “I played the villain in Jwalantham, a character that gave me a good break in the Kannada film industry. There has been no looking back since then and I have been playing baddie in many films,” says Yashwanth. Up next, he has director Guru Deshpande’s Samhaara, in which he plays a negative character, albeit one with a twist. “This is my second film with Guru, after John Jani Janardhan. In our first film together I was the villain, but Guru insisted that I emote with my eyes and not so much with machismo. In Samhaara also, he has given me a different characterization. I play Maanja, who comes across as an innocent fellow, but is actually very cunning. He is forever plotting and planning and his character leads to a major surprise element in the end of the tale. I share screen space mostly with Hariprriya, who is also in a negative shade,” says the actor.Interestingly, in his upcoming projects, Yashwanth is doing a mix of hero, villain and supporting cast characters. In fact, in Sooji Dhara, he is paired with Hariprriya, while he is the antagonist in Atharva and a few others. “I also play a pivotal role in the upcoming Nirup Bandari and Radhika Pandit film,” he says.And what has Yashwanth excited about each of these roles is the diversity in them. “Even when playing baddie, filmmakers have not typecast me,” he signs off.',\n",
       " 'Iain Hume of Kerala Blasters interviews footballers Wes Brown and Rino Anto for the sixth anniversary of Kochi TimesAlthough the Indian Super League (ISL) is in its infancy, it has made giant strides when it comes to popularising football in a country whose first love is cricket. What has probably made this possible is the right mix of Indian talents and foreign players in teams.To throw light on the reach of football in India, the evolving fan culture and more, we caught up with Kerala Blasters players - Malayali Rino Anto and Wes Brown, who had also played for England and Manchester United:Most football leagues in the world are 60 to 100 years old, and comparing ISL to these is unrealistic. But do you think the league is moving in the right direction?Wes: In Europe, we live football and we would start a lot earlier. I didn’t go to Manchester United till I was 12 or 13. But nowadays the starting age is five or six, and so you get the basics right away and playing becomes routine. And then you get drafted to the football clubs.From what I have seen in this season, the ISL is moving in the right direction and the experienced foreign players coming in have really helped as well. The Indian lads will push that on and hopefully people will watch more football and the sport will grow. That way I am sure Indian footballers would get to play in Europe in the future.Rino, this year the league started offering two-year deals to Indian players. Do players like you and CK Vineeth view that as a positive move?I was in the I-League first, and they didn’t have multiple-year contracts like in the European clubs. I think young Indian players need to be offered at least three years, so they know they are safe and will be able to give their best without being worried about what’s going to happen to them next year.We know how passionate South India is when it comes to football. Do you have any pointers on how the North too can develop their fan base?Rino: Actually the fan base is swelling everywhere. In Pune, the number of fans has risen this year. In Delhi, it’s less because cricket is more popular. States like Kerala and Goa have always enjoyed great support. In Bengaluru, I read the other day that their fan base has actually doubled in the past year alone.Wes, having played in Europe all through your career and having seen the fans bases there, do you think there’s a chance of a similar fan culture here?From the grounds we played at, we can see that there are fans. When we play at home in Kerala, our fans are unbelievable. They are the best I have seen. In Kochi, we had about 45,000 in attendance but in Delhi, there were only 4,000. That’s a massive difference. But I think that will change as the game grows.Do you think the rivalries between fanbases are healthy for football in India?Wes: That’s how I grew up. I am a Manchester United fan, and we are passionate about our team. I used to always look forward to the games against Liverpool and Manchester City games, and that’s all that fans talked about a week before the matches.Even now, my friends and I get into big discussions in our WhatsApp groups. We would all love to be the manager of the team and throw in our inputs, but at the end you just want your team to win. Even if they don’t, it doesn’t mean we aren’t going to support them.Do you think getting more local players would lead to more fans turning up to support?Rino: Definitely. Players like Sahal Abdul Samad, Jishnu Balakrishnan and Sujith MS are from North Kerala. More people want to see them playing. We have now about six to seven local players and that number is improving, and I am hoping more fans too attend the matches.What do you think the foreign players such as Wes Brown, Berbatov and Marcelinho have brought to the ISL?Rino: India has a great talent pool and the sport is growing in the country. However, we can’t play in Europe as we are low in the rankings. Most of us have watched these players only on TV, so playing with them is exciting and also great opportunity for us to learn and improve.Wes, I have been in the same boat as you and never in a million years dreamt of playing in India. What has struck you on a personal level about being here?When I was offered the deal, I talked to a few players I know and have played here. They told me it was a great experience. I came here with an open mind and I have really enjoyed it. The standard is pretty good and the Indian lads are great. It’s a lot different than I what I am used to, the weather being one. It’s very hot but I am not going to complain. I look forward to going on a holiday for the five weeks we have off every year in the summer in England. So, being here is great for me.',\n",
       " 'It’s been very hectic; I’m exhausted and haven’t slept.” That, in a nutshell, sums up the past few days of Shruti Prakash’s life. The singer-actress has been much in demand since her stint on the just-concluded season of Bigg Boss, in which she was one of the top-five contestants. We caught up with her in the midst all the bustle, during which she spoke to us about co-contestants JK and Chandan Shetty, and her future in the Kannada entertainment industry…Many people were convinced that you and JK were/are in a relationship. Is there any truth to that?I don’t blame the audience for pairing me with JK, because that is what they saw. The whole day’s activities are packed into an hour for TV, but what you see in that one hour is not necessarily true. JK and I are extremely good friends, but there wasn’t even the R of romance between us. We used to hit each other, and how! We had a lot of fun, but the JK was the same with Anu (Anupama Gowda) and Krishi (Thapanda) as well. I guess people like our pair, due to which our portions were highlighted.Were you apprehensive about speaking in Kannada? Yes. The first question that the team of the show asked me was how fluent I was in Kannada. I told them that I can converse in Kannada, but I am not fluent in it. Mind you, this was a conversation that we were having in Kannada, which lasted an hour, at the end of which they were happy with my knowledge of the language. Initially in the house, I was conscious about speaking in Kannada, and it was difficult to convey what I wanted to say, but over time, my language definitely improved; now, I don’t have to think about what I want to say.So, does that mean that we will see more of you in Karnataka… in films, perhaps?Yes, but there is nothing planned yet. It will probably be in films, but I want to take a little time before deciding on my first project.And a song with Chandan as well?We have plans of collaborating. We first plan on recording and shooting the song that he made for me in the house, which we plan on doing in different languages apart from Kannada, such as Telugu, Tamil, English and Hindi. And we will work on more songs together.',\n",
       " 'History was set this January 26, as for the first time ever, a women’s team of daredevils performed stunts on heavy-duty bikes that left audiences on the edge of their seats. Traditionally, BSF and Army’s bike-borne daredevils end the Republic Day parade in Delhi on alternate years. But this year, it was members of the BSF’s women motorcycle team, Seema Bhawani, who did the honours. The 113-member squad has women aged between 25 and 30 years, who were carefully chosen from different combat ranks. Among them was BSF constable Shruti Huddar, who hails from Shahapur, Belagavi.Shruti’s welcome in Belagavi was nothing short of the kind heroes receive. Married to an Army constable, Shruti was first welcomed with great pomp and show at her in-law’s house, before she visited her parents, who showered her with flowers as she walked into the house, where a pleasant surprise was in store for her. “I am so happy that all my relatives are here to welcome me today. This is such a nice surprise. Being showered with flowers feels very special,” Shruti tells us.Once she met her family, Shruti took some time out to speak to us about her journey with the BSF. “My father was in the army, and I wanted to follow his footsteps. Every since I was a child, I dreamt of serving the nation, which is why I joined the BSF in 2012. Through the years, I was posted in different parts of the country. In November, I joined the women’s bike stunt team and we began training for the Republic Day parade. We trained on a 350 CC bike; many of the women didn’t know how to ride a bike, so they began learning to do so from scratch. Initially, we were very scared, but we never gave up. We were given the opportunity to perform on R-Day in Delhi and we showed everyone what we are made of,” she beams.Recalling the historical moment, Shruti says, “Just as we began our stunts, there was complete silence, but soon, the entire venue erupted with applause. That felt very good and we were all very proud.”Shruti says that whatever she has achieved has been because of the support she received from her parents, in-laws and husband. “My husband and in-laws supported me completely and it was only because of them and my parents that I could achieve this feat. Girls should not be afraid; they should be go-getters and make their parents proud with whatever they do. Parents, on their part, must not discriminate between boys and girls, and must educate their daughters,” she signs off.— Krishna Kamble',\n",
       " 'Madhu DaithotaHi. This is Kannada rapper Chandan Shetty,” he says on picking up the call. The Bigg Boss Kannada Season 5 winner has not had a moment to sit down with family and soak in his big victory, and has only been giving back-to-back interviews to TV channels and various publications. “But I’m not complaining. It’s been tiring, yes, but I wouldn’t have it any other way. This has been my parents’ dream. I had initially rejected the offer to be on Bigg Boss, but they insisted and I took it up. They felt that I have not got my due for my rapping skills and that this could be the best platform to showcase my talent to its full extent. They wanted me to be known as Kannada rapper Chandan Shetty, so that’s what I’d like to be called henceforth,” he says.The Sakleshpur boy says that he hasn’t been able to fully grasp the extent of his popularity, but got a glimpse of it as he came out of the Bigg Boss home that is located at a film city on the outskirts of the city. “Some 300 school kids had come to visit the film city and on seeing me, they came running towards me screaming ‘Chandan, Chandan’ and I was taken aback by the kind of admiration they had for me. I was pleasantly surprised to know that even school kids had been watching the show,” he says.Chandan adds, “Frankly, when I entered the show, all I wanted to do was to ensure that I survive for 98 days — the stipulated period which would get me the payment we had agreed upon. Also, never during my interactions with Sudeep did I get an inkling that I had attained such popularity outside. Only after my win, the makers of the show revealed to me that this was done intentionally so that I don’t get a clue of the kind of response I had generated outside. All I knew was that everybody was liking the kind of music I was making inside the BB home. C’mon think, of it, I was not involved in controversies nor was I buttering people up, so I didn’t think I stood a great chance of fetching attention.”So, what did he enjoy most about his stint on the show? “It taught me survival skills. To be in the same environment 24/7 for over three months with the same folks, some of whom you may not even like, is a lesson in itself. In the process, to not lose your individuality and to find various ways to keep it alive is what I enjoyed most,” Chandan tells us. The stint has also taught him a few precious lessons, adds the Kannada rapper. “People had a notion that Chandan Shetty heavy duddu ittavne, rich music videos madtane, so he must be a loud guy. But I am extremely shy in real life. Bigg Boss taught me to open up and talk. I started opening up after the first few weeks and I’m glad that I have become talkative today,” he points out. Another interesting observation audiences have made is Chandan’s deep thoughts and philosophical ideas that he’s expressed on the show. “I’ve always been that way. But it’s from books — I’m a bad reader. But I am a great listener. Life experiences have also made me what I am today and I explain that through examples. For instance, I compared Bigg Boss to an ocean, its technicians to ships and the days there to the waves. Each of them have a big role to play in pushing the ship towards its destination and that’s what Bigg Boss does to all of us,” concurs Chandan. Finally, the big question: what next? “To make more music. My sole aim is to put Kannada rap on the world stage and make it play alongside English music. Kannada rapper Chandan Shetty will do that some day, and that’s a promise,” he sums up.Love NotesChandan’s fondness for Shruti Prakash wasfrequently shown on the show. What’s happening on that front? “Ayyo, adu sumne dove madkondu idde. Everybody was aware of it. It getsboring sometimes and to keep myself happy, I indulged in such playful things. She knows it, too. But yes, my friendship with Diwakar is true. Unlike what some contestants shared on TV interviews after elimination, I genuinely like Diwakar and it wasn’t a ploy to get votes from the common man,” says Chandan.Sanity skillsBeing in the BB house can break you down sometimes and Chandan’s way of staying sane was music. “Luckily, I found a piece of furniture on which I could drum. Also, talking to Nivedita was a great stress buster,” he adds.',\n",
       " 'Sri Balaji, who made Kullanari Koottam with Vishnu Vishal and Ramya Nambeesan, has now completed shooting his next, Enga Kaatula Mazhai, which, he says, is a city-based romcom. “There is a saying in Tamil, kaiku ettinadhu vaaikku ettala. In the film, three characters, played by hero Mithun, Appukutty and Arul Doss, are after something and who gets it in the end is what the plot is all about. There is also a cute romantic track between Mithun and Sruthi Ramakrishna,” he reveals.The film also has a Golden Retriever as part of its cast and the director states that the dog is the biggest strength of the film, as it is sure to appeal to kids and family audiences. “The Golden Retriever is Appukutty’s pet, and will be a constant presence in the scenes between Appukutty and Mithun, who play friends from a small-town who bump into each other in the city.”Balaji says that rather than breeds like Alsatian or Rajapalayam, which look terrifying, he wanted a dog that looked appealing. However, the team couldn’t find any trained Golden Retriever at all. They enquired with many vets in the city and finally zeroed in on this particular golden retriever, called Douglas. However, they had to train the animal because it is actually someone’s pet. “We hired an animal trainer, who visited the pet’s place every day for three months, and trained him,” he informs, adding that they also got the required approvals for using the dog from the Animal Welfare Board of India. The director also made Appukutty visit the dog at its home and spend some time with him as he wanted the two to become familiar with each other as the dog had to listen to Apputkutty’s instructions in the film.Interestingly, in every scene that the dog appears, you will hear his mind-voice, informs the filmmaker. “The dog will provide counters to the hero’s actions and I wanted a voice that captures the nakkal in its punchlines. The voice had to be familiar as well, so, we roped in VJ Aadhavan from Adithya TV to lend his voice. His performance is sure to crack you up,” says Balaji.',\n",
       " 'Kiruthiga Udhayanidhi, who donned the director’s cap for Vanakkam Chennai, a romcom, is back to direction with Kaali. But this time, she says that her movie starring Vijay Antony in the lead is an action family drama. As she is juggling working on the post-production, supervising the re-recording and also the dubbing sessions, she finds time to talk to us about the movie, working with Vijay Antony and more.After Vanakkam Chennai in 2013, you took a long time to come up with your next...I would say kick-staring the project was the most difficult phase for me. After Vanakkam Chennai, I worked on different drafts and eventually met Vijay Antony with this script.Is there any particular reason for choosing Vijay Antony for the lead?He is someone who thinks out of the box and looks for different scripts and roles. There are not many producers and actors who support diverse stories and different approaches in filmmaking. But when Vijay Antony heard the story, he loved it and immediately agreed to act and produce it as well. That’s how Kaali began. I did faced hiccups till it started, but after that, it has been a smooth sailing. There were quite a few complicated sequences in my movie, and they were a challenge to shoot. But when I saw the outcome, I was very happy.How was it working with Vijay Antony?Both of us share a good working relation. In fact, we’ve become friends now! It was very easy to communicate with him and try different methods in filmmaking. In fact, Kaali is a collaboration between Vijay Antony and me. Starting from the pre-production stage, he has given me a lot of inputs to better the movie. Since this is a village subject, I don’t have much exposure to such living and his inputs have immensely helped me to shape up the project. The movie has the right amount of action. But I am not an action person at all. So, that, too, was a challenge to shoot.He is a musician known for his chartbusters and he has also composed the music for this movie. Which aspect of Vijay Antony did you like the most?I would say, first and foremost, I like him as a producer. He has been very supportive and doesn’t allow any compromise on the quality and production values. He has put in his best efforts, in both the music and acting department, in equal measures. While the songs have come out very well, he has tried to perfect the role by trying out various techniques.Kaali is the title of a Rajinikanth-starrer that released in 1980. Why did you choose the same for your movie?There is an interesting story behind it. Usually, the director goes to the actor’s place for story narration. But, Vijay came to my residence for the narration. My original script had a character called Kaali and half way through the narration, he said that we should title the movie Kaali. I was so happy that he showed so much interest and even suggested the title that I immediately agreed. At that point, I didn’t worry about how we were going to go about the title registration process. I’ve seen his films and I know he has a keen sense when it comes to choosing titles. Because of that, we have brought in a lot of factors in the script. Now, the movie’s hero is called Kaali and there’s a twist even in that, which I can’t reveal!So, what genre does this film belong to?Classifying this movie under a particular genre is difficult. Actually, it has a bit of everything — there’s drama, there’s romance, there’s action and there’s also an element of suspense in it. We can maybe call it an action family drama. It’s a village-based offbeat theme, but has been treated commercially.The film’s songs were up for download free of cost. Are there any other plans to tackle piracy as well?I think only the producer can answer this question. Vijay is someone who is very particular about his work. The whole shooting spot was under tight security and he safeguards his footage. Releasing the song with a video was completely his idea. But I’m not sure what idea he has for tackling the piracy issues.What are the biggest pluses of being a woman director?I’m often asked this question, but I don’t think gender matters in this profession. I agree that the industry is a male-dominated one and people think that women have a tough time because of that. But at the end of the day, what matters is the story you want to narrate, your hero and the producer who’s backing you. I don’t think Vijay doubted my potential as a director at any point of time just because I was a woman. I think only those who do not belong to the industry have such notion. We were just two women on the set (my assistant and I) and there were 100 men around us, but it never changed or affected the style of our work. We work towards our aim and try finishing what we want to achieve on the day.Your husband, Udhayanidhi Stalin, is a busy actor and a producer. What’s his contribution to this movie?He has been very supportive; he used to take care of our kids while I was away shooting. And without his support, I would not have been able to manage both the film and my family.',\n",
       " 'Music knows no bounds, it is commonly said, but it seems to be a totally different case for the youth in the State, especially when they break away from conventions and choose an alternative genre of music to pursue. This prompted me to interact with aspiring performers recently — Abhijith Damodaran, who is doing his BA Music in Maharaja’s College and Steve Kotoor, a BCom student from Sacred Hearts College.The conversation arose out of the interest to unravel that aspect which might help artistes sustain musically in the long run. This is because sometimes relying on one’s own mechanism to get one forward doesn’t always work and it is always better to look into the next generation and imbibe one or two perspectives.While I could sense a reflection of my struggles and journey in these youngsters, it was also a way to learn if there has been a change in the way parents and teachers approach them.Abhijith Damodaran is into alternative and progressive rock and keeps himself busy performing for two bands Pagli and Rock Story. He, like many young musicians in Kerala, is constantly in pursuit of making it to the mainstream.Ask him about the support he receives and he says, “Because only a few in our society can comprehend and appreciate metal and progressive rock music, it will never be an easy journey till people are not acclimatised to music beyond Carnatic. My friends who have been passionately following independent music have found it tough to get past these struggles and are left with no choice but to do film music.” Abhijith says that most of the mainstream artistes too are in a comfort zone and do not invite improvisations.It was this passion for a genre that is considered alien by traditionalists in our place that struck a chord with me.However, there are also those like Steve who enjoys the support of his parents. Steve’s dad Samson is a pianist and has always been pushing him to hone his music skills.“Right from my childhood, my family has boosted my confidence to showcase my talent. Even now when I am contemplating on making this my full-fledged profession after college, they ensure that I am given the required support and encouragement,” says Steve, who is into melody and Jazz music, and is active in the college band Heartian and another group called Octaves.While the intensity of the struggle might seem trivial when they are in college because they are busy juggling academics and extracurricular activities, once they are out in the real world and pursuing these interests, it grows manifold.Just like how I was at their age, these students are aware of the strenuous times ahead. Abhijith says, “We know that if we make it to a popular band, we would do well but otherwise, the money that we make out of performances might not suffice for a living.”That way our struggles might look the same. But the difference is that after school, there was no such thing as band culture for me, and it was only when I left for Chennai post college that the horizons widened. Social media too now plays a major part in being a launch pad for these kids.These youngsters are clear about what they want and are equipping themselves with all the necessary resources. Steve has completed Eighth Grade in keyboard and Abhijith has tried his hand at programming. They are also aware of the importance of marketing and positioning oneself, and the tendency of the audience to rally behind film songs rather the independent music.However, both of them seem to be practical when they say that it’s also important not to be uptight during the initial years of your career.The path of independent music is a road less travelled even today, according to majority of the youth. I hope that this phenomenon changes for the better and the sky becomes the limit for youngsters to explore their talents.',\n",
       " 'On Tuesday, a mentally ill middle-aged woman from Vypeen was brutally assaulted by her female neighbours who even placed a hot spatula on her bare soleA few days back, a man who had fallen from a building at Padma Junction in Kochi was left unattended by indifferent bystanders on the road for nearly 15 minutesRecently, an eight-month pregnant woman died after she fell through the open door of a moving bus at Erattupetta. She was forced to stand as none in the bus gave her a seatThese are just a few among the innumerable incidents that have been happening in Kerala in the recent times, where I saw people being alarmingly apathetic and inhuman towards their fellow beings. To quote Dalai Lama, love and compassion are necessities, not luxuries. Without them, humanity cannot survive. Also, peace does not mean an absence of conflicts but solving these differences through peaceful means — dialogue, education, knowledge and through humane means.Humanity is the essence of a healthy society, and it is high time we gave it a thought. Have our fast paced lives made us cynical, hard-hearted and unkind?I took a stroll through the streets of Kochi and spoke to a few citizens, a colleague, and also some prominent individuals to find solutions to the problem.READ ALSOWhen Jayasurya went out to hunt for newsThe actor had recently turned reporter for Kochi Times on our sixth anniverseryISSUE‘Taking someone to hospital lands us in trouble’ - Santhosh, auto driver from PalluruthyThe traffic police tell us that we don’t need to worry if we take the victim of an accident to hospital. But at times, helping someone ultimately lands us in trouble. I had taken a woman, an accident victim, to hospital but at the hospital, they did not allow me or the passerby who accompanied me, to leave until someone took up her responsibility. We were stuck in the hospital till 9 pm at night and I returned home with zero earnings for the day. People like us depend on daily wages to make ends meet. It is true that there are rules, but they remain rules and authorities should ensure that they are followed. So it is not that we don’t want to help the needy but thehospital staff should relieve us as soon as they take over.SOLUTION‘Hospitals are duty bound to take over’ - Karuppasamy, Ernakulam DCPA life is more important than everything else. If ever you spot an accident, immediately take the victim to the nearest hospital. I assure you that the hospitals will do the needful. They are duty bound to inform the police and once the police reach, they will take over. Whoever accompanied the victim will be asked a few queries to gather the basic information but that is just part of the procedure. If you find that a hospital hesitates to admit a patient, call the police directly and action will be taken. The patient will be given the needed help.ISSUE‘It is becoming impossible to walk in public with a boy’ - Final year engineering students Priska Kuriakose, Laleh, Thasleema and Mythili from AngamalyWhen we walk with friends of the opposite gender in public, we feel scared nowadays. The judgmental stares are intolerable. We face the same kind of moral policing when we return to our hostels late after extra classes. As the road to our hostel is a bit shady we ask our boy classmates to accompany us but we are invariably met with stares. People should be protective but not overprotective. Every Individual has the right to privacy and their space should be respected. People, and even the police, tend to react before trying to understand the situation. And whoever is concerned about us should also realise that we are with someone we trust. We have the right to our freedom in democratic India, and it is high time society understood that men and women can harmoniously co-exist. Not all relationships are about sex.SOLUTION‘No law supports moral policing’ - Loknath Behera, DGP, Kerala StateAs per the Indian Constitution, adults have all the freedom to walk, talk and dress the way they like and do whatever they wish. There is no law which supports moral policing in the Constitution. However, one should always keep in mind that with great power comes great responsibility. There are some reasonable restrictions to freedom. If a person walks on the road naked, it becomes obscene and a violation of law. One shouldn’t do anything that harms others, hurts another’s feelings or threatens the nation’s security. I don’t support moral policing at all, not from the public or from the police.ISSUE‘Shouldn’t love, and not religion, take centre stage?’ - Sanjay, scriptwriterMy children have been raised without religion. I have always felt we should bring up our kids to think beyond religion, colour, caste and creed. People try to connect everything with these and are afraid to question irrational actions around. That’s because we have been conditioned right from birth to fear God. The fear of God is ingrained in us, not love. God is someone who nurtures, not punishes. To bring about a change in society, parents and teachers should take the first step. It is not always necessary to handhold our children the way our parents did. We should be a step ahead and tell our children that God resides within us and inside the people around us. Everyone is God and we should respect and love each other, overruling all barriers. Let love, not fear, take centre stage. At a time when religion decides even what we eat, won’t this help to inculcate humane values in our society?SOLUTION‘Bring up children to be good human beings’ - Sri M, spiritual guideFrom childhood inculcate the idea that human beings are more important, not their caste, creed, or religion. But before teaching them, the teachers and parents have to set the right example. Teach children about love and compassion and to be good human beings. It would be difficult in the contemporary scenario but it should be instilled in their minds in a subtle way. If the young parents of today succeed in this, the future generations can be saved. Like Sree Narayana Guru said, all we need is one caste, one religion, one God for all mankind.',\n",
       " 'PUNE: More trains, including high-speed ones, better safety features, modernized railway stations and extension of platforms are some of the items on the budget wish list of the passengers and railway activists in the Pune division.“We hope the Pune division gets some new trains. Also, we are hoping the division is turned into a zone in itself,” said Harsha Shah, the president of the Railway Pravasi Group, on the eve of the Union Budget.Though she believes the railways’ shift towards privatisation is a “bad idea,” Shah does feel the Pune station must be developed like the one in Mumbai. “The station is in need of an immediate facelift. Trains with more than 20 coaches cannot be accommodated on all the platforms. Hopefully, there will be a mention of the station’s redevelopment plan in the budget,” she said and added that Pune must also get some high-speed trains.Since the railway ministry, in the recent past, had stressed on safety and security of train users, passengers expect to see some significant moves in that direction as well.“The area near Lonavla, also called the shat section, may not come under the Pune division, but trains to and from Pune have been facing risks along this stretch due to landslides. In the winters and monsoons, the conditions become worse. The railways had said that a GPS-based navigation system will be set up in the trains to deal with poor visibility caused by fog. We expect all the trains moving to and from Pune to have that system. Also, many places have a problem with trespassing. This issue should be dealt with seriousness,” said Vikalp Jagtap, a frequent train user.Cleanliness is also a big issue among train travellers. “Though things have improved in the trains and at stations, much more needs to be done. Barring platform number 1, other platforms at the Pune station are not very clean. The same can be said about many north-bound trains. Moreover, the suburban network of the Pune division needs to be better developed,” said Rajeev Sharma, a passenger.',\n",

       " 'When debutant director Ravi Ram decided to strike out on his own, after years of assisting filmmaker Guru Prasad, he didn’t have a set plan in mind, but he knew that he wanted to do one film with actor Aniruddha Jhatkar. “When I decided to turn director, I had a bunch of scripts, one of which — a love story — I thought was perfect for Aniruddha. However, when I met him, he was not enthused, as it was pretty much on the lines of the kind of films he has done before. Even though I am a newbie, he entertained me and even had a lengthy discussion about what he was looking at doing next and I realized that he wanted an image makeover of sorts. Once I had clarity on this, I asked him for some time to come up with a story that would be new for him. I went back home and gave it a thought, and wondered why not use a Vishnuvardhan film for inspiration. I looked at films from his last decade and the one that struck me was Simhadriya Simha and his character, Narasimhe Gowda. I set about writing a story about how the village, Simhadri, has been since his death and what transpires when the hero goes there. In that sense, my story is actually a sequel to Simhadriya Simha,” says Ravi. When he then went back to Aniruddha and gave him a narration, the actor was thrilled to bits. “He was onboard almost immediately, as the story is such that he plays Narasimhe Gowda’s son. We then asked Bharathi amma (Vishnuvardhan’s wife and Aniruddha’s mother-in-law) to take up the role of his mother and we had the perfect setting. Aniruddha, who initially looked at this film as an acting gig, was then hands-on in pretty much every department of filmmaking, to ensure that everything was just perfect,” explains Ravi. The role required Aniruddha to transform himself, including his look, body language and dialogue delivery and the actor, says Ravi, took it upon himself to comply. “He was very dedicated to the role and the film, which made my work much easier,” he says.With the film only a day away from hitting theatres, Ravi says that he is proud of his product. “I not only got to work with an ensemble cast including Bharathi amma and Ambi sir (Ambareesh), but also had a great team onboard, including music director Jassie Gift, whose compositions have lifted the film further,” Ravi says.',\n",

       " 'When you think of the names Dolly and Chitte, you instantly picture two feminine girls. Well, Dhananjaya and Vasishta N Simha are all set to change that with their bad boy characters in Tagaru. Let’s learn more about these characters from the actors themselves…Dhananjaya, aka DollyDolly is a very bad guy by nature and although I can’t be anything like him in real life, I enjoyed essaying this character the most. I was in a trance while playing Dolly, since I was completely immersed in it; I actually had a Dolly hangover. Suri (director) wanted people to see me as a villain, for which he wanted me to get a new look, so that was the first change. But the mental preparation was more; I had to get into the mind space of a rowdy, and with inputs from Suri and my own interpretation of the role, the character began to take shape. This is a very different character. I always wanted to take on an intense role, which is why this excited me. The fun of acting lies in essaying such characters. And I think I have pulled off playing a negative character, since wherever I go now, people call me Dolly.Vasishta N Simha, aka Chitte Dhananjaya and I are good friends in the movie, but we are polar opposites as far as our characteristics are concerned. While Dolly is loud and aggressive, Chitte is a sober, soft spoken, well-behaved guy, who has quite an intellectual side. He is a man of few words, is confident and doesn’t really care about what others say. He is focused on his goals and guides people around him. He has an emotional side as well; there is a love story with him and he has a family connect. It’s a very different portrayal of a rowdy. Dhananjaya and I are friends in real life as well, and he is the more talkative one among us, so our characters in the film are along similar lines of how we are in real life (minus the violence, of course). But when it comes to how we have been portrayed in films, I have taken his part, and he mine.',\n",
       " 'It’s been just days since his return from one of the most challenging races in the world, but CS Santosh is itching to begin training for the next Dakar Rally. The recently-concluded 40th edition of the rally was special for India — Bengaluru’s Santosh, who took part in the rally for the fourth time, not only became the first Indian to finish the race three times, but it was also his best-ever finish — he finished 34th overall.SETBACKS AND PUSHING FORWARDThe race began in Lima, Peru, on January 6, and ended in Córdoba, Argentina, on January 20 — with a total of 14 stages of competition. The first few days were a dream for Santosh — he was in 13th position at the end of the first stage, and remained within the top 30 at the end of the second stretch. What followed were two setbacks — a crash on the fourth day and another on the 11th that set him back. He suffered a concussion, due to which he began riding in the opposite direction, but that didn’t deter him. “When that happens, it feels like it is only happening to you; your world turns upside down. But I had to snap back to reality and I told myself, ‘Sure, it’s going to be hard for you, but it is hard for everyone else as well.’ I kept going and I had some difficult days, but I kept telling myself that things will change (for the better). I was able to make a comeback with a lot of positions. But it was the two days in the beginning that made my whole Dakar experience awesome,” says Santosh.THE TOUGHEST DAKAR EVERParticipating in the rally for the fourth time, what felt different this time around? “The general consensus this year was that this was the hardest Dakar ever, which made it so much more special to finish it. In the first couple of days, I was with the top riders in the world, which was a big encouragement for me to go back next year and do well. I’m really excited for what the future holds,” says Santosh. His eyes are firmly set on the Dakar 2019, with the aim to finish in the top 20. “Every year I learn something, and I have been putting all of that together. This year, I made the biggest progress. I need to continue working the way I did last year to achieve my goals,” he says.ITCHING TO GET BACKBack from a gruelling 14 days, one would expect Santosh to be looking forward to taking some quality time off to unwind. But that is far from what this young rider has on his mid. “I have a few days off, and then I begin training again. When you are used to racing at 100 mph down a dirt road, regular life gets a bit dull. I am looking forward to racing again. I have recovered from the injuries I sustained during the rally and I’m raring to start riding again,” he says.And what else do we have to look forward to from him? “In April, I am doing a project for which I will be racing with another athlete who will jump out of an airplane in a jumpsuit. It is a first-of-its-kind project that will be shot in Rajasthan.” Adventure, it seems, is always a part of Santosh’s plans.',\n",

The lapses have been reported in main office and zonal offices. As per section 12 of Kerala Municipality (Manner of Inspection and Audit System) Rules, 1997, the secretary shall submit all the records, registers and accounts required in writing by the auditor. If the secretary fails to submit any records or accounts, it shall be deemed that such record or account is not in existence and may arrive at a conclusion accordingly.The secretary and the employees concerned shall have the responsibility for removing the references that may occur in the audit report regarding the objection or disallowance of expenditure that may be brought to notice at the time of audit, by producing records, if available, at the time of audit itself.The audit report mentions an instance at Attipra zonal office where 13 files related to regularisation of unauthorised buildings are deemed to be missing. It further adds that no reply was also furnished by the zonal office regarding missing documents.The officials have also failed to produce documents related to issuance of building permits and regularisation from main office, the report explains in one chapter. It says that audit had issued notice to then secretary and superintending engineer but to no avail.In 2015 when a school building had collapsed at Muttathara, the engineering and town planning wing of city corporation had groped in the dark trying to retrieve the files of a building constructed less than 10 years ago.Lack of system of having duplicate filing system as in departments like PWD further worsens the situation.PWD runs the practice of maintaining duplicate files which ensures that the officials get to maintain files and produce them any time they are required. In 2014, the civic body had come under fire from district administration after it failed to produce blue prints of commercial establishments in city which had altered the original building plan and converted mandatory parking space for other purposes. The building applications are not even sorted based on nature of construction or purpose of building.Mayor V K Prasanth had recently made it clear in the meetings that no other person except the official concerned shall be the custodian of files. He had recently withheld files which were produced to him by third parties other than officials. “During this audit, we could submit more than half of the files they asked for.

       " 'Chennai: Laxman Tamant is 90, but he still actively involved in farming at his village Rajahar in the Nawalparasi district of Nepal. His village is now a efficient agro model after a government initiative, which declared it as a climate-smart village 2012. But the situation was different five years ago, when agriculture was badly hit by inconsistent rain and the villagers, who were dependent on traditional farming in this rainfed region, suffered huge losses. While the youth eventually left the village in search of better oppurtunities, the fortunes turned with the new system that brought in solar-based irrigation and promoted maintenance of a community seed bank. The villagers today have started cultivating vegetables, mustards and pulses the village. The Nepal model will work in the remote villages of Tamil Nadu if implemented properly, says Pramod Agarwal, scientist at South Asian chapter of the Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS), who designed the climate smart village in Rajahar and the villages of Maharashtra, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh.Nepal’s agriculture has always been prone to various climatic risk which include droughts, inconsistent rainfalls leading to floods and landslides. It was to find a solution to these issues, the government of Nepal initiated National Climate Change Policy (NCCP) and National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA). With the help of CCAFS, the Nepal government started implementing the climate smart agriculture project. The first change was to introduce an alternative to electricity and diesel pumps to lift water from streams, ponds and underground tube wells. The initiative has helped set up 12 solar based irrigation systems in Bardiya, Dang, Nawalparasi and Mahottari districts of Nepal. “We can operate the irrigation system for six hours a day continuously. It has a capacity to lift 1,00,000 litres daily if there is sufficient sunlight. It helped us a lot and today we cultivate mustard and vegetables in our fields,” said Uttam Kumar, a farmer from Rajahar. “The fields where lentils would struggle to survive are now thriving with wheat, lentils and vegetables,” he said. Since 2016, the government of Nepal has been implementing the climate smart village approach as part of the climate adaptation programme in 14 vulnerable districts in seven states.Similarly, in India more than 60% farmers are rain-fed smallholders with two hectares or less of land. They are all highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Even though many climate-friendly farming methods have been implemented in TN, an initiative like climate smart agriculture is yet to take root. The government’s role is crucial, according to Pramod Agarwal. “Shortage of water is the main problem for farmers in TN. The climate smart agriculture will definitely bear fruit. To begin with, we need to fine-tune the technologies that suit the local environment in the state and supplement them with weather forecast and crop insurance. The project should be linked to state or national policy,” he said.Experts agree to the fact that climate smart villages would work well in the state if implemented properly. However, they believe that the success of the project will depend on the state government. “Climate smart village is a good idea. It will definitely help the farmers of TN. But the role of the state government is big in implementing such projects. NGOs can only help the government. The funding has to come from the state,” said K Veeramani, a research scholar on environmental science at the Tamil Nadu Agriculture University.P Jeganathan, a wildlife and agriculture scientist, said the climate smart village project will help the farmers of TN a lot, as they are facing water shortage in many remote villages of the state. “Any eco-friendly project is welcome. I think the project is suitable for many remote drought-hit villages in TN,” he said. “But at the same time, it should not destroy the existing eco system. If it is going to be implemented keeping in mind the traditional farming practices of that area, it will definitely help,” he said.',\n",

       " 'Panaji: Former Chelsea FC manager Avram Grant took inspiration from Mahatma Gandhi when he guided the club to an unlikely place in the final of the UEFA Champions League in 2008.Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich put his faith in his friend and the then director of football when he showed the door to the Special One in September 2007. Chelsea fans never took to the Israeli manager but despite his unpopularity, he still managed to get the club back on track.Chelsea finished second only to Manchester United by two points, and had it not been for captain John Terry&rsquo;s slip during penalties in the Champions League final against Manchester United, Chelsea would have won the Holy Grail.&ldquo;Mahatma Gandhi is a fine example to the world how you can achieve things in a good way. He is among the three people I have admired all my life,&rdquo; Grant, now coach of NorthEast United FC in the Indian Super League, told TOI in an exclusive interview on Thursday.His other influences include American civil rights hero Martin Luther King and former Egyptian president Anwar Sadat, who fought for peace and was assassinated.&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve read a lot about Mahatma Gandhi since I was a kid. I&rsquo;ve been to places in South Africa where he went and (also) met (Nelson) Mandela. He was a modest man who decided to fight for India&rsquo;s independence without war. He followed a different path and took decisions which were not popular.&ldquo;I know what it is to take decisions when everyone opposes you. I was in the same position when I took over at Chelsea. I had lot of supporters who were against me; the media was completely against me. I know what it is to stick to your ways, even when everyone is against you. I learnt that from (the) Mahatma; he was unique,&rdquo; said Grant.Grant said Chelsea were in terrible shape when he was asked to take over from Mourinho in September 2007.&ldquo;In Chelsea and (later) Portsmouth, I took over a team which was completely destroyed. The media said Chelsea played ugly football, the atmosphere was not good and they were losing games. But in my time, nobody said we played ugly. We played fantastic football. We played differently to what was played earlier (under Mourinho). People from inside the club didn&rsquo;t believe me (that we could go far in the Champions League). We almost won the Champions League. That was a big, big achievement,&rdquo; said the 62-year-old.Despite his success with Chelsea, Grant was sacked at the end of season and eventually succeeded by Luiz Felipe Scolari, who also lost his job before the end of season. This constant sacking of coaches, Grant feels, has done the club more harm than good as Chelsea have been left without an identity of their own.&ldquo;We played fantastic football. It was a good base for the future. I am upset that Chelsea didn&rsquo;t continue in the same way (after I left),&rdquo; he said.Chelsea have had 10 managers since Grant left in 2008, and could have a new manager in place at the start of next season if, as expected, Antonio Conte turns his back on the club and returns to Italy.',\n",

       " 'PUNE: The government has decided to rope in private chemists to strengthen its reporting system for tuberculosis (TB) cases.“This is another way of tracing missing cases of TB. Private doctors are already doing this. By involving chemists, the Union government aims to strengthen this reporting system further. We have already initiated the process of roping in chemists in the state,” state tuberculosis officer Sanjeev Kamble told TOI.The objective here is clear. If a patient comes with a prescription for anti-TB drugs, the chemist will notify the case to the local health authorities.“As per the Schedule H1, which was brought under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act in 2014, the chemists are mandated to keep record of anti-TB drugs and high-end antibiotics sold to patients. That includes maintaining record of patient’s name, address, drugs dispensed and treating doctor’s name. They only need to report this data to the local health authorities so that missing cases can be traced,” Kamble said.The Union health ministry made it mandatory for private medical practitioners to report TB cases to health authorities on May 7, 2012. “But we cannot deny the possibilities of having some gaps in this system. Hence, involving chemists will help,” Kamble said.Manjiri Gharat, vice-president of Indian Pharmaceutical Association, said this is not for the first time that the country’s chemists have been roped in to fight TB. “The Centre had signed a memorandum of understanding with us in 2012 to train chemists as DOTS (Directly Observed Treatment, Short Course) provider so that a patient takes his or her daily dose by visiting the neighbourhood chemist. In Maharashtra, we have trained over 1,000 chemists, but the move faced legal hurdles in other states,” Gharat said.“We are yet to devise methods about reporting TB patients’ data to the health authorities. Some chemists have computerised data. Hence, for them collating and compiling data of TB drugs dispensed under schedule H1 is easy. But many chemists keep manual data, making the reporting of the data difficult,” Gharat added.There are 8,000 chemists in the state. “We will devise a mutually convenient mechanism to get patient data from chemists. We can send health workers to them if they find it difficult to send the data to the local authorities,” Kamble said.',\n",

Interestingly, FC Goa are still to face Delhi Dynamos in the second leg of the ISL, and even though Goa recorded their biggest victory this season with a 5-1 demolition of Delhi, the visitors could still pose a problem or two when they come calling on February 21.&ldquo;Boumous has already applied for his visa and should be here anytime soon. He was doing his pre-season in Turkey and is ready to help us,&rdquo; said one official from FC Goa.Boumous is likely to be available for next week&rsquo;s away clash against Bengaluru FC.Lobera&rsquo;s decision to part ways with Arana, according to sources, comes from the Spanish winger&rsquo;s desire to have more game time. Lobera is also understood to have been in favour of a foreign cover for Edu Bedia and Ahmed Jahouh in central midfield. And it helps that Boumous can easily slot in as defensive or attacking midfielder.FC Goa are currently placed fourth on the ISL table with 19 points from 11 matches and have a tricky run of matches before they can seal their place among the top four.

       " 'INDORE: Number of seizure of weapons and cases registered under Arms Act has increased drastically in the past one year. Weapons seized and gangs busted in the past few months tells the tale of the thriving trade of guns manufactured by members of Sikligar community - a small caste of armourers and knife grinders settled in Malwa region of the state.Read any crime report and you will notice how most of those people involved in crimes in city use country-made weapons, known in local parlance, ‘desi katta’. There are agents active in the city who will get you any kind of gun you want — .32 bore country-made pistols (the desi katta) to double barrel guns — anything you fancy, for hard cash.Crime branch officials said that the number of cases registered under Arms Act have increased drastically in the last year.Senior officials said that the most of the weapons are brought into the market via brokers and agents and even if one of them is caught, cops are able to reach the others. The problem faced in getting a gun licence issued has also paved way for black market of weapons produced by Sikligars to thrive in city.“Mostly people arrested with arms claimed that they had bought it for extortion and to show off in the group,” said ASP crime branch Amrendra Singh.Last year, the city police had recovered more than 100 such illegal weapons, most of them used by people arrested in crimes like robbery, chain/purse snatching and carjackers.According to police source, ‘desi katta’ is available in the city in the price range between Rs 2,500 and Rs 5,000. “Criminals use country-made pistols, usually with .32 cartridges and most of them were recovered during arrests,” a senior police officer said.On an average, five to seven criminals are arrested with illegal weapons every month. Most of these illegal firearms are brought from nearby regions in Barwani, Dhar, Khargone and Khandwa. Easy availability and affordable price have pushed the demand of these weapons in a region where property disputes are very common.Of the 1,315 cases registered under Arms Act in 2017, according to the police record, around 220 firearms and cartridges were recovered, all of which were illegal.A senior police officer admitted though they are arrested time to time, arm suppliers are still active in the city.“We regularly check on type of elements involved in illegal arms crime,” said a senior police officer.Migrant population coming from different areas is into this illegal arm trade for livelihood and for easy money. Mostly, goons in different areas like to keep the weapons to show off in their group.',\n",

Hospital authorities said the man, Vasanthamani, had multiple health problems.Vasanthamani, who was operated on by a team of neurosurgeons for haemorrhage on January 26, had been on ventilator since then. “We don't know the cause of his death. Since it was a medico-legal case, we are carrying out a postmortem,” said a senior doctor in the GVMCH.However, the death of Vasanthamani triggered a controversy. His relatives alleged that he succumbed to the injuries he suffered at the hands of the Kalasapakkam MLA and his supporters who beat him up badly during a marriage function in Polur town on January 21.“My brother had been suffering from haemophilia since childhood. But he was healthy. He sustained serious head injuries when the MLA and his supporters assaulted him. We want police to take action against the MLA and others responsible for his death,” said Vasanthamani’s brother, Murthy.His relatives staged a road blockade opposite Kalasapakam bus stand on Wednesday morning demanding the arrest of the MLA.Vasanthamani had decorated the venue of a function held at Kalasapakkam on the birth anniversary of AIADMK founder and former Tamil Nadu chief minister M G Ramachandran on January 17. After the programme, he approached the MLA to collect money. The MLA gave him Rs 500 and Rs 6,000 on two occasions. When he approached the MLA again for the balance amount, the MLA gave him Rs 5,000 and allegedly abused him. Upset over this, Vasanthamani went to the MLA’s house on January 21 in an inebriated condition and damaged the windshield of his car. Later, he went to a marriage hall in the town and slippered the MLA and punched him on his face.Angered over this, the MLA and his supporters beat him up and handed him over to police. He was lodged in the Vellore Central Prison for Men on January 23.“There was no external injury when he was lodged in the prison. But he complained of discomfort. He passed urine with blood in it. We suspected that he might sustain internal injuries. We admitted him to GH. He was discharged and brought back to the prison in the afternoon of January 25,” said superintendent of central prison G Shanmugha Sundaram.\",\n",

Of them, most were related to ATM frauds, said police on Wednesday.Of the 2,307 cases registered in 2017, maximum cases – 1065 – were related to ATM frauds. “Maximum cases were related to ATM frauds. Apart from this, over hundred cases related to lottery frauds were registered. Jobs and loans, insurance, online shopping, fake share trading companies, debit and credit cards and account related frauds were some other categories under which the cases were registered,” said ASP crime branch Amrendra Singh.The team has managed to solve the complaints received in three ways, claimed the ASP.“We blocked the card or money in most of the cases or wherever it was possible. Some cases were registered and some others were asked to return money without registering cases,” said ASP Singh.He added that a different trend was witnessed in the types of crimes in city. While most of the complaints received were related to the complainant being from the city, this year crime branch received complaints from people based out of other states and the accused were from Indore.“The complainants and police reached out to us from different parts of the country as the cyber activities and frauds had taken place in Indore,” said ASP Singh adding that appropriate action was initiated in the matter.Since the officials at city police stations are not entirely aware of the ways of handling cyber crimes, a special team of trained cops under the crime branch deals with the cases.“A team of five persons, including a senior officer and constables, handles these cases.

It found that the STP was illegal. The men had been engaged to clean the STP.“As per records, the apartment owners had not applied for ‘Consent for Operation’ of STP and hence it was unauthorized,” said K B Obalesh, state convener of the Samithi. “In a joint inspection that was held by KSPCB and BWSSB on June 12, 2017, it was found that the apartment was operating the STP without proper authorization. The inspection report also noted that the treatment process of the STP was non-compliant with the specified discharge standards.” The apartment builder had only obtained consent for establishment of the STP in 2006.This was the third incident of manual scavengers dying in an apartment in the last 18 months. There were similar incidents in two different apartments in Yeshwantpur and Whitefield.“These deaths could have been prevented if the BWSSB, while mandating establishment of STPs in apartments, had asked the question of who will clean these STPs,” Obalesh said. “BWSSB also should have put in place guidelines on cleaning of STPs in compliance with the provisions of the Prevention of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act 2013.”They Samithi demanded that all unauthorized and non-compliant STPs be shut down immediately. “KSPCB should issue immediate notification prohibiting engagements of human beings for cleaning, repair and maintenance of STPs which is a criminal offence as per Section 7 of The Prevention of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act 2013,” Obalesh said.When contacted, Jagadish Hiremani, National Commission of Safai Karmachari, who had recently inspected the STP, said that the apartment hadn’t followed due procedures.“During my inspection, it was learnt that the apartment hadn’t obtained the required permission from the government. The police were told to take cognizance of this,” said Hiremani.He said he was yet to get documents pertaining to the apartment which he had requested from the BBMP, BWSSB, KSPCB. “I have written my second letter to the civic agencies seeking documents pertaining to the apartment,” he said.Office bearers of the apartment welfare association were unavailable for comment.',\n",
       " 'Bengaluru: A sexual harassment complaint filed by a 31-year-old woman against two youngsters backfired on her when Viveknagar police confronted her with a CCTV footage retrieved from a nearby shop and reprimanded her for filing a false case.The woman, a private company staffer and an Ejipura resident, had parked her car on the crowded Ejipura Main Road on January 24 when four bike-borne youngsters hurried to take their injured friend to a clinic for treatment. As her car was causing a traffic snarl they reportedly told her to move aside and make way for other vehicles. The woman had taken objection to it and a verbal argument broke out between them.Two traffic policemen rushed to the spot and ordered the woman not to block traffic and told the youngsters to leave the place. But in her complaint, the woman had alleged: “The four did not leave the spot and the cops did nothing. When I was heading towards the police station, they followed by car and made obscene signs.”Based on her complaint, Viveknagar police commenced investigation and retrieved a video clip from the CCTV camera installed in a building where the alleged incident took place. After analyzing the video and recording statements from local residents, police concluded that the woman had made false allegations.“We also traced two of the bike-borne youngsters and recorded their statement. They told us that their friend Immanuel was injured after an accident at Srinivagilu area a few minutes before the incident. They were taking him to nearby clinic for the treatment when they found the road being blocked by the woman’s car. We checked with the clinic and the doctors confirmed that Immanuel was treated there. In fact, the woman was found to have continued with her verbal argument instead of giving way for other motorists,” a police officer said.Police claimed to have closed the case after issuing a warning to the woman.',\n",

       " 'Bengaluru: Anxious eyes waited for nearly an hour here at the Jawaharlal Nehru Planetarium to get a glimpse of the Super Blue Blood Moon on Wednesday evening. Though the rare phenomenon took its time to unfurl, it didn’t deter space enthusiasts from witnessing the spectacle.At 7pm, the entire planetarium erupted in cheers as a perfect round, copper-red moon unravelled before them. While some enjoyed the magical view through naked eyes, others turned to telescopes for the best view. “This is special because we will be able to see the moon rise as it gets eclipsed by the Earth’s shadow. This isn’t something that happens during every eclipse,” said Pramod Galgali, the planetarium director.The last time the world witnessed this rare phenomenon was in 1982 and the next one will occur in 2037.Six telescopes and two binoculars were set up at the planetarium for the public to see the moon up close. But those who didn’t get a chance at the telescope weren’t disappointed as the expert explained that the phenomenon could be seen through naked eyes too.Over 50 students from classes 5 to 9 of Little Flower School, Karur, Tamil Nadu, had visited the planetarium as well. “We came here on an educational trip to see Isro, Visvesvaraya Museum and witness the eclipse from the planetarium. We learned so much over the last few days here,” said Shashank M K, a Class 8 student.Geetha K G, a science researcher, who also calls herself an amateur astronomer, camped right beside a telescope and began explaining everything about the phenomenon that could be witnessed on Wednesday.“Blood moon, super moon and even blue moon are terms that have been coined recently. Yes, the moon is closer to the earth, but its actuality can’t be determined with the naked eye or telescope. To us, it will look like how the moon looks every day, only red,” she said.Age was no bar for Vittala Rao K, a 75-year-old, who came to the planetarium with his entire family and waited patiently by the telescope to see the Super Blue Blood Moon. “I used to bring my grandchildren here when they were young. Today, being an apt day to visit the planetarium, I made sure that everyone in the family came early from work. These are places where science is made fun and interesting,” he said.',\n",
       " \"BENGALURU: A full-fledged suburban rail system for Bengaluru, similar to the one in Mumbai, is likely to be a reality in three years. Giving a major push to the long-pending project, the state cabinet on Wednesday decided to release its share of funds for the 44-km suburban rail network.Law minister T B Jayachandra said the project, which involves running 56 trains with 116 rail services, is estimated to cost Rs 10,949 crore. “The state government will release Rs 349 crore for the first phase, which will need a total amount of Rs 1,670 crore,” he said.The plan is to have a rail network between Bengaluru and Mandya, Bengaluru and Yeshwantpur, Yeshwantpur and Tumakuru, Yeshwantpur and Yelahanka, Yelahanka and Byappanahalli, Yelahanka and Chikkaballapur, Yelahanka and Doddaballapur, Bengaluru and Bangarpet and Kunigal and Soladevanahalli.Though the government had decided to take up the project last year, it did not take off as Karnataka was rankled by the cost-sharing mechanism under the National Suburban Rail Policy released by the Centre.As per the policy, the state and the railways were to share 20 per cent each and the remaining 60 per cent was to be arranged through the special purpose vehicle (SPV) with the state acting as the guarantor for the loan. While the state was batting for a 50:50 partnership, the railways was firm that it will not provide any more contribution.“Since we have been made the guarantor, the state will end up bearing 80 per cent of the cost. Still we decided to go ahead with the project considering its significance to decongest Bengaluru,” Jayachandra said.The first report that recommended a suburban rail project for the city was prepared in 1983. Since then eight detailed project reports had been prepared and the latest was in 2015 which was again updated in 2017 by the directorate of urban land transport (DULT), an arm of the state government. In addition to these seven reports, several studies were commissioned and reports prepared on the city's transport system.90 smart signalsThe cabinet approved a proposal to install 90 smart signals in the Central Business District (CBD). The government has proposed to set up the adaptive road traffic signal system or sensor-based signals that can adjust the duration of red and green lights at junctions, depending on the density of vehicles at 355 junctions at a cost of Rs 85 crore. The city has nearly 400 traffic signals.Jayachandra said adaptive traffic signals are more effective compared to traditional ones, which have pre-programmed timings, and it will help reduce shortage of manpower.\",\n",
       " 'BENGALURU: The Karnataka Nataka Academy’s decision to change the design of the trophy for its annual awards to be conferred on theatre personalities on February 24 this year has snowballed into controversy with a few members raising objection.The academy has so far been giving away a memento, comprising a metallic sculpture of Nataraja along with the citation and Rs 25,000. The general body of the academy that met on December 7, however, decided to change the design of the memento. Accordingly, an abstract artwork has been designed.“The general opinion is that the Nataraja image is synonymous with dance. Since the academy is about theatre art and we are honouring theatre personalities for their achievements, we thought the memento should be apt,” said J Lokesh, chairman of the Karnataka Nataka Academy.Lokesh claimed that only one among 18 members opposed the proposal and the academy was going ahead with the change since the resolution was passed with a majority.“The order has already been placed and art director Sudesh Mahan is sculpting them. The trophies are expected to be ready in 10 days,” said Lokesh.R Venkataraju, member of the academy, who opposed the proposal at the meeting, said there were other members who shared the same opinion. “They say I was the only to dissent at the meeting, but my dissent has not been formally recorded. This shows that I’m not the only one who had a different opinion. All I’m saying is that there’s no need for changing the design of the trophy which has been there for years,” said Venkataraju.Not the first timeThe design underwent changes on earlier occasions too. When C G Krishnaswamy was the chairman between 1998 and 2001, the memento was changed into a stone chariot of Hampi. In 1999, it was turned into a metallic cannon, symbolising the heritage of Vijayapura where the award distribution ceremony was held that year. Otherwise, it remained the same by and large since the inception of the academy in 1978.This time, 25 theatre personalities are being honoured with the annual awards and veteran Prasanna is being conferred with the life-time achievement award that carries the memento, citation and a cash prize of Rs 50,000.Ideological war?The controversy has assumed political overtones with the theatre fraternity divided on ideological left and right lines. Some view it as a move to impose the leftist ideology on the academy.“The move has given way to think that the leftist agenda is being imposed. There’s no need to change Nataraja sculpture which is a universal symbol of dance and drama,” said Nagarajamurthy, former member of the academy.Pointing out that even the memento given by the central body, Sangeet Natak Akademi, has the Nataraja sculpture, he said the state academy’s move has come at a time when ideological headwinds blowing over Karnataka ahead of the assembly polls.Academy chairman Lokesh, however, has found supporters among theatre artistes who said it’s a progressive move.“It’s unfortunate that the change is being seen as an agenda. This is not the first time that the memento is being changed, it was the replica of a cannon in 1999. Is an abstract piece worse than the symbol of war?” asked Shashidhar Yadahalli, member of the academy.',\n",

Minister for water resources and government spokesman Narottam Mishra said, “Those liquor shops falling within 50 metres of girls schools and colleges, hostels for girl students and religious places will be closed down with effect from April 1, 2018.”Last year, the government had implemented the Supreme Court order of shifting all liquor outlets to beyond 500 metres from national highways. This year, the government took the decision to create certain “dry zones”. “Madhya Pradesh will now have stretches of dry zones where liquor will no longer be permitted. These dry zones will be near holy rivers apart from the girls’ education institutions,” Mishra specified.“More than 65 country and foreign liquor shops have been shut down from near the banks of the Narmada last year. Now, more restricted zones will be created,” the minister said. Out of 2,700 “ahatas” in the state, 149 will be closed down. Number for liquor shops that come in the dry zones is not yet known.The state government now gives you the facility to check whether the liquor bottle you just purchased is genuine or spurious. “To curb sale of spurious liquor, the government decided to give consumers ability to test genuineness of the product. Consumer can click a photograph of the hologram on the bottle and send it to number 562634500 and will promptly know whether he purchased an original or spurious bottle,” Mishra explained.Details of movement of liquor from the warehouses to the liquor shops will be available online. To stop sale of illicit liquor in the rural areas, district and village committees will be appointed. The government has also made provisions for graver punishment and bigger penalty for sale of spurious liquor. The home department has been asked to give suggestions on how punishment for crimes related to spurious sale of liquor can be made by adding an extra clause.The government said even after closing down of liquor shops and ahatas, the state’s revenue from licences will increase by 15%. To give a boost to tourist spots, the cabinet decided to reduce bar licence fee of outlets in resorts.',\n",

The underprivileged children get free education till they reach Class VIII and the government reimburses fees to private schools for teaching them.The reimbursement is fixed by calculating average of money spent per child in a government school or the fee per child taken by a school, whichever is less.“We haven’t received reimbursement for past one year.

We will also cancel admission of already existing students after February in case the government fails to pay dues,” Singh added.KPS Tomar, nodal officer, RTE Madhya Pradesh, said, “We have urged the schools not to take this step. The government has approved the grants but due to shift to online system, it will take some more time.”The private schools also decided to start a massive agitation in mid February against pending payments.Many school associations have come together across the state, demanding they be reimbursed all pending dues against free admissions given for RTE's 25% quota else no admissions will be given.“The online system has been started only after receiving complaints of siphoning off of grants. We won’t let the students suffer as Aadhaar card has been made mandatory document to be submitted by the schools to receive fee.

He then moved Supreme Court but the CBI special court issued an arrest warrant against him on January 27.Goenka was pinning his hopes on Supreme Court. But on Tuesday SC rejected the anticipatory bail application of three other Vyapam accused — director of LN Medical College Jainarayan Chouksey, former joint DME Dr N M Srivastava and former director of state’s medico legal institute Dr D K Satpathy. This gave an indication to Goenka that his plea too could be rejected, so he decided to surrender in court.His counsel, Ajay Gupta, told TOI that Goenka had not received any summons from CBI or the court. “My client surrendered before the court. We gave in writing before the court that he was not absconding. CBI gave wrong information to the court during the hearing on January 27 on which an arrest warrant was issued. CBI never directed my client to appear in court. In court, we filed a copy of the notice that CBI sent to Dr Goenka. There is no direction in the notice to appear in court. My client was pursuing his legal remedy of seeking anticipatory bail and was avoiding arrest on advice of his lawyers. He is not at all concerned with happened in the Vyapam scam. He was implicated,” said Gupta.CBI’s counsel advocate Satish Dinkar said, “Goenka was trying to justify his delay in appearing before court. It is just an attempt to get bail.”Gupta requested the court not to put handcuffs on Goenka. In response, special judge Dinesh Prasad Mishra directed that a note be written in red ink on the warrant not to handcuff Goenka. He is now in Bhopal Central Jail.',\n",
       " \"NEW DELHI: The IAF’s counter-intelligence wing has detained a senior officer posted at the Air Headquarters here for allegedly leaking classified documents to a woman among other persons, in what is suspected to be an espionage ring being run from Pakistan.The officer, a Group Captain (equivalent to a Colonel in the Army), was allegedly using his smart phone to click pictures of classified documents at the Air Headquarters and then using the popular messaging platform “WhatsApp” to transmit them to the woman, whose identity is not yet clear, said sources.The officer, who had access to a certain level of secret documents and plans due to his posting at the Air Headquarters, had apparently got to know the woman initially through the social networking website “Facebook”. There is suspicion that the officer could have been “honey-trapped and compromised” by the woman at some stage during their relationship, and could have been in touch with his “handlers” for the last few months.“The Group Captain, who is a para-jumping instructor but not from the flying branch, is being interrogated after being taken into custody from the Race Course Road area. It is being ascertained whether he is part of some larger espionage ring,” said a source.But the IAF, on being contacted, refused to say anything on the matter. Sources, on their part, said it was during “routine counter intelligence surveillance” being conducted by the IAF's Central Security and Investigation Team that it was discovered that the Group Captain “was indulging in certain unwanted activities through unauthorized electronic devices which is against existing orders”.There are strict instructions in place in the armed forces to ensure classified information and data is not compromised through the improper use of Internet or social networking websites like Facebook, Orkut and Twitter. But there have been several such cases in recent years.Several military officers have also been caught in honey-traps- basically an intelligence operation for first seducing and then blackmailing a person into divulging confidential information– over the last several years. In 2011, for instance, the Navy had sacked Commodore Sukhjinder Singh after his sexually explicit pictures with a Russian woman had surfaced.Singh was posted in Moscow as part of the Indian negotiating team for the acquisition of aircraft carrier, Admiral Gorshkov (now rechristened INS Vikramaditya), for which India finally agreed to pay $2.33 billion after protracted and bitter negotiations with Russia.In another major commercial espionage case, in which three Navy and one IAF officer were arrested, a staggering 7,000 pages of classified information were 'compromised' from the naval war-room in South Block and the air defence directorate in Air Headquarters in what came to be known as the Navy war-room leak case in May 2005.The IAF, of course, was also stunned by the arrest of Air Vice-Marshal K H Larkins and his brother Major General FD Larkins, along with two others, for passing classified military documents to US intelligence agents in 1983. They were sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment in 1985, but were granted bail after some years for good conduct.\",\n",

       " 'PUNE: As a matter of principle, Neil MacGregor has never worked in museums that charge entry fee to its visitors. He believes that art should be accessible to all, so much so that he even declined an offer from the Metropolitan Museum in New York.“I know that most Indian museums charge a fee, and I believe that should not be the case. However, it is for Indian politicians to decide. And, we also need to recognize that a museum needs to be well-funded, so that it is well-run,” MacGregor remarked.He was speaking at an event organized by the Symbiosis School of Liberal Arts in collaboration with the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalay — the erstwhile Prince of Wales museum — in Mumbai, at a special exhibition of shared artefacts and telling a story over a timeline. The British Museum is one of the partners who have lent exhibits to the facility.MacGregor is a veteran as far as curating art and artefacts are concerned. He has been the director of both National Gallery and British Museum — the flagship conservation institutions of the United Kingdom that are publicly funded. He is also responsible for the practice of sharing the museum collection with other countries. He was instrumental in the UK lending the Cyrus Cylinder to a Tehran museum in 2012, which originated from the Mesopotamian civilization, considered the first ever human rights edict. Nearly a million people viewed the exhibit in Tehran.He left the British Museum in 2015 and is currently busy setting up the Humboldt Forum in Berlin, a museum coming up within the refurbished Berlin Palace. In his current India project, he has managed to bring in a painting by Rembrandt of the Mughal emperor Jahangir, and a Portuguese illustration of an Indian rhinoceros, the only one Europeans knew of till as late as the 1930s. These are among the 124 exhibits on display.“This project is to evoke inter-cultural dialogue. The exhibition has been termed India and the World and the artefacts are both about how India viewed the world and how the world thought of India in the same historical period. And, while there are cultural differences across the world, humans have always strived for the same thing. For example, all the regions in the world have potteries. All civilizations have attempted to codify laws and proclamations. The manners have been slightly different across cultures, but the traditions still remain. If you look at Chinese inscriptions, they have always tried to portray the One China principle, by codifying the characters. It continued to this day,” MacGregor explained.In his years of studying Indian inscriptions, he has noticed that emperors have come and gone since Ashoka and governments have turned from colonial to democratic, but Ashokan principles have been a constant, even in the Indian constitution.“History has been full of wars and Ashoka waged many of them. But then he asserted his authority by his edicts on various monuments all over his empire, in multiple languages, telling people how to behave, while maintaining distance from all religions. And B R Ambedkar’s principles were similar when he wrote the Constitution. It is fascinating how traditions stay on,” he remarked during his lecture.MacGregor is popular because of his radio and TV shows, his programmes on history, religion, and even Shakespearean studies, reaching almost the same level of recognition as Bill Nye’s in science popularization.“The young need to be educated in art and history. In India, it starts at home because of the vast religious mythology and history, much of which is visual. For example, most children in the Hindu households know about Lord Ganesha. Similarly, in Muslim households, the calligraphy of Arabic in the Quran and other texts play a big part. That is how the art education can take form, so that they grow up to appreciate it,” MacGregor smiled.',\n",
       " 'JAIPUR: Farmers from several parts of Rajasthan voiced their fears about growing incidents of cow vigilantism, as they could no longer get rid of the unwanted bovines.Farmers who turned up for a Jan Sunwai (public hearing) at the leader of opposition Rameshwar Dudi’s residence at Civil Lines before the budget session of state assembly beginning on February 5 said their agony was aggravated by cow vigilantes.“We are unable to sell unwanted livestock due to fear unleashed by cow vigilantes. We are forced to abandon them but it creates further complications as the bovines eat up crops,” said Remtharam Meghwal, a farmer from Deedwana in Nagaur district.“There are Goshalas (cow shelters) in each village which are now overcrowded and thousands of bovines are roaming around the village as there is no way to get rid of these animals,” added Mehgwal.After agriculture, animal husbandry is a major occupation of the people in Rajasthan. According to the latest animal survey (2012) Rajasthan accounted for 5.77 crore livestocks, the largest in the country. Farmers used to earn an extra income from sale of non-milching livestocks, but that has now come to a deadend after Modi government came to power, he elaborated.Bhawarlal Gorchia, a farmer from Nokha block in Bikaner district, said, “The ground nut farmers are a harassed lot as the government procures only 25 tonnes of the produce at the support price of Rs 4,450 per quintal. The farmers were forced to sell the remaining portion of their produce at throw-away prices of Rs 30-32 per kg in the open market.”Some farmers complained that on one hand they were unable to avail remunerative price for their produce, on the other the input costs are going up due to high prices of diesel, GST on agriculture equipment, etc which has added to their problem.Rajasthan is a water deficit state. The state government has been encouraging farmers to adopt drip irrigation but he said the GST has come as a big dampener. Praveen Chaudhary from Bikaner said the sprinkler system brought under GST is an anti-farmer retrograde step.',\n",
       " 'Mangaluru: Mayor Kavitha Sanil on Wednesday came down heavily on the officials of Mangaluru City Corporation for not translating her directives into action. This has resulted in MCC not meeting revenue targets under various heads including property tax, which in turn has affected the ability of the civic body to make payments to contractors. Revenue shortfall against budget estimates is affecting delivery of services, she added.Chairing the general meeting of the council of the MCC, Kavitha replying to a query by Premananda Shetty, former leader of the opposition on revenue collections and delay in payment to contractors, said pending dues under property tax and water bills for the fiscal amounted to nearly Rs 70 crore. Her suggestion that corporators across party lines must evince interest in helping mop up these dues sparked off a verbal battle between the ruling Congress and the opposition BJP.A visibly agitated mayor reminded the council that her writ alone does not carry weight and it is upto the officials to act on her directives. “Even when I direct the officials to disconnect water supply to major defaulters, they do not act on it. The same is the case with trade license dues and any other major head of revenue,” the mayor said.“I cannot drag the officials from their houses and get them to act for they have to discharge their duties,” she said.Commissioner Mohammad Nazeer said the problem with revenue is that the mismatch between the budget estimates and actual recoveries under respective heads. Normally there is 20-25% variation in the estimates and the actual receipts, he said. The other issue is that most of the revenue payments happen in the last month of the fiscal and this is where the gap is bridged, he said, adding the corporation has to do a fine balancing act in the interim adjusting payments to stakeholders.The process of demonetization saw MCC achieve 96% receipts in property tax against projection and around Rs 36 crore in water bills during 2016-17. MCC as on December 31, 2017, collected Rs 23.87 crore from supply of water and expects revenue of Rs 26.54 crore against projected revenue till the end of this fiscal, he said. The bulk payments in March will help the civic body bring down payments to contractors from 9 months to around three months, he added.',\n",
       " 'JAIPUR: At a time when the unsettling impact of demonetization and GST is still playing out, expectations are actually high from the Central budget that would be announced on Thursday by finance minister Arun Jaitley. But what has also been a big concern for the people is the consistent rise in fuel prices in recent months which is making everything costlier stretching the household budgets.“When crude prices were trading around $35 per barrel, the government did not reduce the prices. At that time, people though anticipated lower prices, they did not protest thinking that the government will take care when the prices would go up. Now, the crude prices have gone up but the government is not providing the relief,” said Swati Kapoor, a teacher who now uses her Scooty to travel to the school thrice a week instead of the car even though she feels it’s a little riskier.If the government, which obviously manages the prices even though fuel prices have been deregulated, cannot take care of such basic necessities, nobody would believe in the ‘acche din’ promised by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government, she said. Kapoor drew attention to the pile of profits the oil marketing companies are making while the common man is suffering.The common assessment this time around is that the government will reach out to people in the penultimate year of the general elections and use the Budget to mollify the resentment that GST and demonetization has created. The belief is strong despite the fact that the PM has already said that he will not tread the populist road.“There is an expectation that the finance minister will tinker the income tax slabs by increasing the exemption limit. But even if the government does it, it may not mean much. Savings of Rs 5,000-7,000 actually has no meaning if the prices of every other item goes up,” said Abhisek Mishra, director of a realty firm.Mishra said what a common man needs is lower EMIs for his housing and car loans, reduced rates for fuels and electricity, and less tax burden. “Unless the government meets these expectations, the grand faith reposed in the Modi government will result in widespread discontent.”After the devolution of divisible funds increased to 42% for states, many of the welfare schemes were discontinued by the Centre putting the onus on the states to continue them. Rajasthan was a major beneficiary in many water related programmes, but the state government could not continue several of those need-based schemes.“Water, health and education should be top priority for a country like India. While the cost of these services are going up for urban population, the rural folks are getting deprived of such basic necessities. The budget needs to address these problems with a priority. Self-employed people at lower social strata need social security,” said Sanjay Ghiya, a leading tax consultant in the city.He said health services are costlier because of government policies. “Tariffs for electricity and water for hospitals are charged at commercial rates. Many of the health services attract 18-28% GST. With such an environment, we cannot expect the hospital charges to be cheaper. Hope, this budget takes a considerate view of this,” added Ghiya.',\n",

But, after settling in quickly, the first thing that Vikramaditya requested to his brother was to let him drive the car to Jaipur. And he was allowed his freedom drive. “The flight from Oman to Delhi was delayed by four hours. He landed at 4 pm,” said Harshvardhan on Wednesday.TOI also spoke to Vikramaditya while they halted at Behor on the way to Jaipur.“The second day after I was sent to my employer, I was treated as a driver and domestic help. It was then I realized that I was cheated by my agent Mukesh Singh Chauhan. I was lucky as I could narrate my plight to my family over phone before my employer snatched away my cellphone. I was not been given salary and was told that it was being directly credited into the account of my agent,” said Vikramaditya.He now feels that looking for a job in countries like Oman was a mistake. “I will advise youth, labourers and others to first enquire properly about the agent and the job before making a final decision,” he said.Despite his ordeal, in which he had also handed over his gold chain to the agent, Vikramaditya is happy that his misery has come to an end. “I am happy to be back. I will soon meet my parents who must have prayed every day for my safe return,” he said.Back home in Jaipur, Vikramaditya’s mother Ichraj Kanwar (58) was excited and waiting for the arrival of her son.“Baati daal banayi hai, mataji ro aashirwad chora ke kaam aayo hai (I have prepared daal and baati. The blessing of goddess helped my son),” said an elated Ichraj Kanwar at her Jaswant Nagar residence in Khatipura locality in Jhotwara, speaking to TOI.His father Mahaveer Singh (61) said, “We were expecting him to land at Delhi at 10 am. However, my son Harshvardhan said that the flight was delayed by four hours. Hopefully, we will have dinner with him.”Other than Rathore’s family, a large number of neighbours had also gathered at the house to welcome Vikramaditya.“Ab to khana Vikram ke saath hi khayenge (Now, we will have dinner with Vikram),” said Mahaveer.',\n",

The DC has already held meetings with all the departments concerned and given each of them specific directions to address the same, he said.Admitting that MCC too has limited liability in the river getting polluted, Nazeer said the DC has asked the civic body to ensure that no sewage joins the river through open storm water drains. In addition, there is the issue of untreated effluents discharged from industrial units in Jokatte that join the river downstream of the Gurupur vented dam and the same get stacked against the dam with the ingress of salt water from the sea upwards towards the dam, he said.The pollutants and any debris in the river and the sea that flow inland normally gets dissipated with free flow of river water upto December and pollutants tend to get accumulated downstream of the dam once the planks are lowered to supply drinking water, he said.

Firoz Khan, a social activist who regularly tours these areas, told TOI that in recent travels in Bakanpura of Kishanganj block of Baran district, he had found several people who showed him ration cards and complained that they got nothing at all.Khan said that as families grew, some of the younger members who had married and had families of their own had begun to live away from the parental homes. These units had acquired new cards, but since the government had only sanctioned free rations for old ration cards, the new card holders were not able to avail the benefits of the free rations made available by the state government to Sahariyas. At Bakanpura alone, Khan came across 198 card holders who had not been able to get free rations.Regardless of the type of ration card held by this aboriginal backward community, the government has assured them free rations – each Sahariya person is entitled to 5 kg wheat, half litre of cooking oil, quarter litre of ghee and half kg pulses each month.In 2013, after many cases of child malnutrition and death were reported from the area, Komal Srivastava and Ashok Khandelwal conducted a survey of over 200 households in the district to find that social indicators were indeed very poor – only 7% of those surveyed had over two bighas of irrigated land; of 760 people questioned, 58% had never been to school; 41% of those surveyed had outstanding loans.Food and supplies officer for the district Harlal Meena said the complaints were mostly from holders of new ration cards.

Moreover, it is compulsory to fix an hour and provide free medical check-ups to poor patients at the outdoor patients department (OPD). Similarly, 10% beds should be reserved for the poor. However, majority of hospitals have failed to fulfil the terms and conditions,” an official source said.The decision to tighten the noose against these hospitals has taken after several complaints reached chief minister’s office.

But every month, the developer has increased water charges by including it in maintenance charges. Moreover, the water supplied is not safe for drinking and bathing,” said Shivani.As there is no policy, the developers are fixing charges according to their whims and fancies. Residents also complained that the state government should not approve projects that do not provide water facilities.Moreover, it’s the government’s duty to provide water to every citizen at the same rate. “Like other housing colonies, the government should define charges for apartments too so that customers know how much money they have to pay and whether they are being overcharged,” said Vijay Singh, an owner of a flat in a private society in Swej Farm.This charge has become an additional burden for buyers who are already paying maintenance fee for amenities such as club house, power back-up, cleanliness, etc.Currently, for a 1,000 sq ft flat costing Rs 3,000 per sq ft, a buyer has to pay a minmium of Rs 50,000-75,000 for parking and maintenance. They have to now additionally pay another Rs 50,000-60,000 for water which increases the overall cost and puts additional burden on the buyer.The government’s recent proposal to levy charges from buyers for laying water pipes has given a freehand to these unscrupulous developers. The public health engineering department (PHED) has proposed that individuals buying flats should pay Rs 62 per sq ft of the construction area for laying pipelines from the nearest pump house to the building concerned.The proposal has been mooted on a pilot basis for multistorey buildings in Bapu Nagar, Civil Lines, Bani Park and Adarsh Nagar, covering around 10 sq km area.Ratna Kanwar, who recently purchased a flat on Kalwar Road, said, “The builders continue to supply water from a borewell and charge us extra claiming that water pipelines will be laid in the future. The customers have not been informed about the charges for supplying water. We don’t even know when the lines will be laid. But the developers are taking the money now.”In the absence of a proper government policy to provide water connection to these complexes, the situation is becoming grave for residents. Majority of these group housing schemes are coming in the city outskirts such as Jagatpura, Ajmer Road, Kalwar Road, Sirsi Road, Sikar Road, etc. Abhishek Sharma, a city developer, said, “The money has been taken in advance to avoid future conflicts with customers. We cannot depend on groundwater for long. We are charging buyers so as to connect these complexes to a robust network of water pipelines.”',\n",

Two parliamentary seats, Alwar and Ajmer, and one assembly seat, Mandalgarh, went to bypolls, with both the ruling BJP and Congress claiming victory.The counting of votes for Alwar parliamentary seat will be held at the Shobaram Government Arts College, Alwar, and the Ajmer Lok Sabha seat at Government Polytechnic, Ajmer. As for the Mandalgarh assembly seat, it will be held at Government Polytechnic College, Tilak Nagar, Bhilwara, said a spokesperson of the chief electoral officer (CEO).The counting will begin at 8 am after completing the ‘mandatory verification’ process. Under the verification process, the voter verifiable paper audit trail (VVPAT) from randomly selected EVMS will be matched with the votes recorded in the EVMs to ensure that there is no anomaly. This will be done in the presence of returning officers and observers in the presence the candidates’ agents.A total of 42 candidates are in the fray for the bypolls which were held on Monday.PCC president Sachin Pilot claimed that the Congress would bag all the three seats. “The kind of support, co-operation and affection received from people in areas where bypolls were held emboldens me to believe that Congress is on course to win all three seats with a thumping majority. The anger against the BJP government was palpable at all places.”The BJP too expressed confidence that the bypoll results would be a stamp of approval for the good governance of four years of Vasundhara Raje government. “As in the Dholpur bypoll, which saw people voting for development and BJP, in these bypolls too, they have voted for us. The results on Thurday will prove it,” said Ashok Parnami, BJP state president.In Alwar, Jaswant Singh Yadav of BJP and Karan Singh Yadav of the Congress are the main contenders, while Raghu Sharma of Congress and BJP's Ramswaroop Lamba are in contention at Ajmer.BJP's Shakti Singh Hada and Congress’s Vivek Dhakad are vying for the Mandalgarh seat.The bypolls to all the three seats were necessitated after the sudden death of BJP MPs Sanwarlal Jat in Ajmer, Mahant Chand Nath Yogi in Alwar, and MLA Kirti Kumari in Mandalgarh.

       " 'Mangaluru: The Federation of Indian Rationalist Associations has termed the religious and cultural practices followed during a lunar eclipse as “myths”. To debunk them, rationalists in the city organised a moon-viewing session on Wednesday, and consumed food under the eclipsed moon at the Mangaluru City Corporation swimming pool premises in the evening.Their move followed inactivity at temples during the eclipse. In addition to scrapping rituals and services, temples were also shut for devotees for some time.An official of the Shri Durga Parameshwari Temple, Kateel, told TOI the reason for not keeping the temples open was that prasadam had to be distributed to devotees if they visited the temples. “However, the lunar eclipse is an inauspicious occasion, and has to be spent by meditating, praying and fasting. That’s why we shut the doors of temples for devotees,” he said.“The effect of the first lunar eclipse of the year will be seen in the entire month of ‘Magh’. On this day, the moon will appear in three colours; such a moon was seen three decades ago. On the day of ‘Chandra Grahan,’ it is considered inauspicious to see God, therefore, the doors of the temple are closed on this day. The lunar eclipse will also start the ‘Sutak’ time. The Sutak begins at 7am and ends at 8.45pm. This eclipse will be auspicious for some people, but inauspicious for others. On this day, the moon will look bigger than on ordinary days, and a blood moon will appear in the sky,” he said.However, Narendra Nayak, president, Federation of Indian Rationalist Associations, termed this a myth. He said astrologers were a confused lot.“The appearance of the moon in three colours is a myth. Astrologers are confused between spreading their superstitions and trying to use the terminology of modern science. A blue moon is an additional full moon that appears in a sub-division of a year: either the third or fourth full moon in a season, or the second full moon in a calendar month.”The rationalists believe the phrase has nothing to do with the actual colour of the moon, although a literal blue moon (the moon appearing with a tinge of blue) may occur in certain atmospheric conditions, like during volcanic eruptions or fires leaving particles in the atmosphere of just the right size, to preferentially scatter red light.“If the gods are so powerful, why should they be scared about an ordinary eclipse? If they are scared, what is their power? Not only temples, all places of worship, including churches and mosques, should be closed forever so that there will be less conflict,” Nayak added.Meanwhile, Muslims too offered a special eclipse namaaz and a khutba after the Maghrib Namaaz. The Holy Quran directs the community to indulge in prayer during solar and lunar eclipses.',\n",

Mohsin is on the run while the other two, Tariq (22) and Danish (21), have been arrested.Around 5pm on Monday, the boy and his two sisters were on their way for classes when two men approached them. They wanted help in figuring out the way to the boy’s uncle’s house. One of the men convinced the two sisters to return home while the other went ahead with the boy.They took the boy to Loni border and from there boarded a bus to Panipat. The child was forced to have a cold drink that was laced with sedatives and put to sleep in the bus. The kidnappers booked a hotel room in Panipat and kept the boy there for the night.Meanwhile, the boy’s family was extremely worried and looked around for him frantically.

       " 'Mangaluru: The menace of bull trawling as well as fishing using lights is likely to come to an end from the fishing season that starts in August.Understanding the perils of mass fishing techniques, that has been the cause for depleting fish stocks along the coast, the fishermen community, both in Udupi and Dakshina Kannada, has come together to put an end to bull trawling and fishing using lights from August.The Caveat: If bull trawling is resorted to by fishermen, those indulging in fishing using lights will also take it up, said sources. The issue was discussed at a recent meeting held by fisheries minister Pramod Madhwaraj in Udupi.Though the Union government has banned the use of LED lights while fishing in all coastal areas in the country, it has been done rampantly in coastal Karnataka, threatening the marine ecology and killing juvenile fish, thereby jeopardizing the livelihood of traditional fishermen. Concerned with the ban not being implemented in Karnataka’s coastal waters, the Nadadoni Fishermen Association of Uttara Kannada had written to the ministry of agriculture and farmers welfare, to instruct the district administrations of Uttara Kannada, Udupi and Dakshina Kannada to strictly enforce the ban on LED fishing and bull trawling.Purse Siener Fishermen’s Association president Umesh Karkera says with only 42% Mogaveeras in the fishing industry, it is largely dominated by ‘other commercial interests,’ who want to make a quick buck on their investments. “We understand the deleterious effects of bull trawling and fishing using LED lights. But it works on a quid pro quo basis. Bull trawling which happens in September and October is more dangerous, which leads to a depletion in the number of fish, which forced local fishermen, especially Purse Siener boats, to engage in fishing using lights,’’ he said.Karkera says a fishling requires about six months to grow fully, but bull trawling completely eliminates juveniles, and thus affects the species itself. “This is why we want a ban on both these types of fishing practices which cause mass destruction,’’ he said.The situation is such that premium fish is arriving in Mangaluru at exorbitant rates. White pomfret which was common in city fish markets, now comes from Kerala and commands a premium. As on Wednesday, no local catch of white pomfret arrived in the market, but white pomfret have been supplied from Kerala, which is selling at Rs 1,100 per kilo. The usual rate of white pomfret hovers around the Rs 900 per kilo during this period.',\n",

Instead of singing away our woes, you could have given a report card of your inefficient government in Meghalaya. Your indifference mocks us,” the BJP’s Meghalaya unit tweeted. It also tweeted an image of a Burberry jacket, similar to the one that Rahul wore, having a price tag of $995 (around Rs 63,000).For BJP, it marked an opening to get even with the Congress leader who mocked PM Narendra Modi’s decision to wear a suit embroidered with his name during the visit of then US president Barack Obama. Congress used Modi’s choice of attire for a conversation over tea with Obama to dub BJP “suit boot ki sarkar” in a bid to sharpen its charge of a pro-rich bias.Rahul had attended a concert in Shillong, apparently to reach out to young voters. Dressed in denim trousers and a black jacket, he urged the youth to love and respect each other to make the country strong.BJP’s charge that the jacket was bought with black money drew a sharp reaction from the Congress. Rahul tried to dismiss the controversy by later claiming it was a gift. Speaking to a television channel, he said it had been gifted to him, though he didn’t disclose who it was.Rahul tried to toughen it out by hurling “suit boot ki sarkar” jibe again at the PM at an event in the poll-bound state, saying Modi was always found in the company of people attired in suits and not with the poor. “You will not see him (Modi) hug a poor person, talk to a poor person or even engage with a poor person. You will see him with others. There is a particular distance he maintains with poor people which he does not with Mr Obama or others,” he said.Congress MP Renuka Chaudhary came to her boss’s defence and alleged that BJP was leading a “suit-boot ki sarkar” at the Centre, and had no moral authority to question Rahul. She said the saffron party was “frustrated” due to Rahul's “rising popularity”. “Their frustration is directly proportionate to the rising popularity of Rahul Gandhi. Rahul Gandhi connects with the young,” Chowdhury said, adding that she could show that the “same jacket” was available for Rs 700.WATCH'Suit-boot' war takes a new turn, BJP hits out at Rahul Gandhi for wearing jacket costing Rs 63000\",\n",

       " \"Apart from her debut Marathi film 'Bucket List', Madhuri Dixit-Nene is also gearing up to collaborate with a host of her B-Town colleagues — Ajay Devgn, Anil Kapoor, Jaaved Jaaferi and Riteish Deshmukh — on the upcoming comedy 'Total Dhamaal'. Speaking about the movie, the dancing diva of the 1990s told BT, “The film is exactly what the title suggests, total dhamaal. It’s freaky and fun. Anil and I will be working together after 18 years. I can’t believe it has been that long since 'Pukar' (2000). We have a great equation even today. I have worked with Ajay and Riteish before, so I can’t wait for this journey to roll.”Interestingly, on Makar Sankranti this year, Madhuri’s first look from her Marathi film, which also stars Sumeet Raghavan, was trending online. The actress, who plays a simple, but strong-headed Puneri housewife in the film, trained to get the Puneri diction right and also learned to ride a bike. She shared, “It’s a slice-of-life, family entertainer. A lot of preparation has gone into it and I am really happy to take up something like this.” Apart from 'Bucket List', Madhuri is also looking forward to her first home production in Marathi. She said, “The film I’ve backed as a producer is also a family entertainer, but it comes with a beautifully woven message. I just feel that even if you don’t understand the message within a story, just enjoy the film for what it is. I love the subjects and emotional quotient of the narrative in both my Marathi films and that’s primarily why I decided to come on board.”\",\n",

BT was the first to tell you that Arjun and Parineeti had been cast for the romantic drama, which will go on floors this month. While it’s known that the movie will be shot in Mumbai, Punjab and the United Kingdom, word is that the film’s narrative virtually travels across half the globe.The story unfolds across Amritsar and Ludhiana in Punjab, moves to Dhaka, Bangladesh, followed by a portion, which will be shot in Brussels, Belgium, apart from sequences shot in parts of London, the UK countryside and Mumbai. When we asked Vipul, he confirmed the news, “I will start shooting very soon and I plan to kick it off with some scenes and then step into the songs. This film is very special for everyone. Yes, it involves a lot of travelling because the script has turned out to be that way. There will be times when my family will join me at work and times when I will be far off, but I want to shoot this film exactly the way the script has shaped up. I want to stick to it and if travelling half the globe is the way to do it, so be it.”\",\n",

The singer-actor says, “If children are not on TV shows, they are happily showcasing their talent on various online platforms. So, why blame TV alone? I started my career as a singer at the age of 18 and social media has played a huge part in it. For small actors who do not have a PR agency, social media is a great platform to connect directly with the audience.”Diljit further stresses that today a child is not a celeb only because he is singing or acting on TV. He elaborates, “Television is not the only medium, which is exploring the talent of children. Nor do they become celebs by making appearances or participating only on music reality shows. They are aware of various platforms online, where they can participate and showcase their talent. Today, children are becoming stars thanks to their talent being showcased on social media platforms. Nobody can escape this kind of attention as they are exposed to it at a young age. TV is not damaging or exploiting anything here... it is this current trend that is capturing children’s talent and putting them in the spotlight.”\",\n",
       " 'Women hate forward to that time of the month. Though referred to as chums, they hardly ‘friendly’, thanks to the stomachache, cramps, and a bloated body that it brings along. However, senior fitness consultant Swapneel Hazare says that there are some exercises that that can help to deal with this. There are women who feel appalled at the idea of exercising during those days. Swapneel explains, “Just like studying regularly prepares you for an exam, similarly exercising regularly before your periods helps relive menstrual cramping and aches by increasing your blood circulation and getting your body ready for the aches and pain.” Doctors say that exercising releases endorphins in your body which not only help to elevate your mood but also help to overcome stress. Clinical dietician Nupur Krishnan says that food cravings are often present during periods. She says, “Foods that are sugary and salty food cravings are unwelcome accompaniment of your chums. To tackle that try eating bananas as they are naturally sweet and high in potassium which will help curb your salt and sugar cravings. Swapneel suggests some exercises that you can do during your periods…Pelvic tiltsPerforming pelvic tilt exercise is important to maintain the mobility in the low back, hips and pelvis. It also helps to maintain and develop abdominal muscle strength and tone. It also provides a mild low back stretch, which can help alleviate the low back pain and discomfort that often accompanies periods. Lie on the floor in a supine position (on your back) with your knees bent. Activate your Abdominal muscles by drawing your belly button towards your spine. You should feel like the hollow of your back(lumbar) is pressing to the floor and your hips and pelvis are rolled upwards towards the ceiling. Hold the position for couple of seconds before returning to the original position. Repeat it about 10 times.Seated Torso Stretch Sit on the floor with both feet straight in front. Bend your right knee and place the right foot next to your left inner thigh. Now rotate from your lumbar area(lower back) and place your left elbow on the outside of your right knee and place your right hand on the floor behind your body. Hold the stretch for a good 15 seconds or more. Repeat the same on the other side.Lying Butterfly StretchLie supine (on your back) on the floor with your legs straight in front. Slowly bring both your feet by joining the soles of your feet together towards your pelvis region or closer to your body. Now slowly let gravity take over and let the thighs drop to the floor. Stay in the position for a good 20 to 30 seconds.Supine High PlankSit on the floor with your feet extended in front and hands placed by your side. Make sure your fingers are pointing in front- towards your feet. Now slowly lift your hips off the floor and hold the position making sure that the feet, knee, hips, shoulder form a straight line. Make sure you keep your chin tucked in towards your chest. The mobility and fitness level will determine how correctly you can hold the high plank position and for how long.BridgingLie Supine on a mat and bring your feet close to your butts. Slowly raise your hips up such that the shoulders hip and the knees form a straight line. Slowly come back to the starting position and raise yourself again without touching your hips down. Bridging helps to strengthen your lower back, hips, and your hamstrings. It is an excellent exercise to activate and tone the posterior chain of muscles.Tips to keep in mind> One needs to carefully choose the exercises she does during her periods. It is advisable to take a break on the day you have a heavy flow.> On the rest of the days of one’s period, stick to light low impact aerobicsexercises that help increase your blood circulation.> Exercises that mobilise the pelvis such as pelvic tilts are beneficial to ease your back pain.> Light yoga stretches are also a good way to relax and release stress during periods. However, intense yoga inversions should be avoided.',\n",

Disciplinary action was taken against 25 public servants in 13 cases, it said.The report said in some cases in the allotment of houses, the discretionary powers were missed by the government servants and the records of such allotments were also not properly maintained.The Lokayukta recommended the state government to formulate proper guidelines to minimize discretionary powers of the officials.The Lokayukta pointed out there was serious irregularities in approval of building plans by the Development Authorities, Municipal corporations and Urban Improvement Trusts and Municipalities.The Lokayukta suggested that the state government could seek guidance form the national Building code and bylaws of other states to remove the gray areas in the approval of buildings and reduce the discretionary powers of the officials.It also recommended formation of a high power committee to amend the building by laws.',\n",

The date is special for the filmmaker, as 'Special 26', which is close to his heart, opened in cinemas on February 8, five years ago. The thriller, set in the 80s, was considered unusual — compared to the typical Bollywood fare — and its success proved that the audiences are indeed ready for different kinds of cinema. Neeraj, whose last directorial was 'MS Dhoni: The Untold Story', is back at the helm of affairs with 'Aiyaary', which is set against the backdrop of the Indian Army. Interestingly, it will see Neeraj collaborating once again with Manoj Bajpayee after 'Special 26', and also with his 'A Wednesday' actors — Naseeruddin Shah and Anupam Kher — after a gap of nine years. The film also stars Sidharth Malhotra, Rakul Preet Singh (former Miss India) and Pooja Chopra (former Miss India) in pivotal roles.Happy over the response the trailer of 'Aiyaary' has garnered, Neeraj says, “After 'A Wednesday', Naseer bhai told me that it’s not the first film, but the second one which is more difficult to make; 'Special 26' was that movie. Five years ago, when it released, we were overwhelmed by the response. It also started our association with Akshay Kumar and we cherish that journey. Most of the core team members who worked with us on that film continue to be with us, and that means a lot.

The latest TV couple to take their relationship to the next level are Poonam Preet and Sanjay Gagnani, who have been dating for the past six years. The duo will exchange rings during the Valentine’s Day week, on February 18, at Surat. However, the wedding date is yet to be finalised.Sanjay says, “There are no marriage plans as of now. Our careers are our priority and we want to invest our energy and time in work.”Coming from the same professional background has helped them understand each other better, says Sanjay. He adds, “Communication is crucial for any relationship to grow. There’s always so much to talk about when you’re from the same industry. Exchanging viewpoints, helping each other, criticising, praising, discussing things about the industry… all this help in creating a better understanding.” Poonam agrees. “When you are in the same profession, especially showbiz, there is no need to clarify when you work overtime,” she says.Ask them what they like best about each other, and Sanjay promptly replies, “Her innocence,” while Poonam says, “His honesty and he is caring.”At a time when marriages aren’t lasting, Poonam says that she is not scared of commitment. “I believe everybody’s destiny is different. So, these things don’t really bother me. I have faith in my relationship and I’m not at all marriage-phobic. I have always dreamt of a fairytale wedding,” she says.Sanjay admits that he was a bit hesitant initially. “I was marriage-phobic. In fact, it has taken me six years to overcome my marriage phobia. It was all because of the bitter experiences I had before I met Poonam. She has made me believe in love again,” he signs off.',\n",
       " 'Last year marked the start of ‘clean sleeping’ and ‘smart sleeping’ as popular trends. This had many people recording their snooze meticulously and also logging the number of hours they spent between the sheets daily. However, sleep professionals suggest that sleep not only keeps you healthy mentally, but also physically and that’s why it’s imperative to incorporate trends, which your body can follow, to keep you going. Telling us how sleep trends are identified each year, sleep professional Dr D Narayanan says, “At the beginning of every year, sleep experts across the country analyse the sleeping patterns people should follow that particular year. This study is done based on the report that professionals collect over the previous year. Through the next course of the year, these trends are then further broken downto understand the patterns of snooze.”If you are wondering what your sleeping style should be for this year, take a cue from these...Sleep bingeingWhile we know that a full night’s sleep is the ultimate form of rest, for most people, it’s a far-fetched dream. Sleep professional Dr Anand Gokhale, opines, “There are many people who grab on some sleep in-between the day, and that’s perfectly fine. For example, if you have woken up at 7 am and have an hour to spend travelling to work, utilise that one hour of travelling for sleep. However, make sure that you remind your body that it’s only an hour of rest that it will be getting. This way your body will know how to sleep binge.”The snooze trackersFast-paced modern lives have made people not only count the number of hours that they stay awake and work, but also the number of hours they spend sleeping. Pragya Suhas Kaul, a 32-year-old advertising professional, who is undergoing therapy for sleep correction says, “Working in a highly stressful job made it difficult for me to fall asleep at night. Even if I did, my body would get these ‘shock waves’ during the night that would wake me up and keep me awake for two to three hours. When I started undergoing treatment, my doctor explained that my body was naturally on trackers.”Made-to-measure sleepWhile you may think it is similar to snooze tracking, it is quite different from the previous one. Dr Narayanan explains, “Whenever you hear someone talk about getting adequate rest and sleep, they will usually be referring to getting about seven to eight hours of sleep. However, one must know that each body type is different and thus, in turn, the sleeping patterns.”Energy boosting napsThe concept of power naps has taken the world by storm and how. Not only are sleep experts advising people on taking them, it is being considered as one of the biggest sleep trends for this year. Shehnaz Gandhi, a medical student specialising in sleep apnea, says, “My students have been visiting several corporate firms in the city and spreading the importance of power naps. Research has shown that energy boosting naps double an individual’s performance at work, and he/she is also able to strike the right chord between his/her professional and personal life.”Losing the race to bedSimilar to sleep bingeing, sleep professionals are emphasising on the need to losing the race to bed. Dr Gokhale explains, “A lot of times when people come back from work, they either sit in front of the television, read a book or try and watch videos online, waiting for dinner time. This is also the moment when someone feels sleepy, but tries to stay awake, so they don’t disrupt their sleeping pattern. However, this year, we suggest that in case one feels this way, they should not bother about staying awake and just lose their race to bed.”',\n",

       " 'NEW DELHI: Staring at a delay in starting Phase IV of its network, Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) has written to Delhi government and the Centre requesting approval to begin work on three of the six proposed corridors.Delhi government is yet to give a final approval to the project, along with financial commitment. This has resulted in the delay in starting construction of the 104-km, Rs 55,208 crore project. The Centre, which has an equal stake in DMRC, will give its approval only after the state gives its final nod.The three routes identified as priority corridors — Janakpuri West to RK Ashram, Maujpur to Mukundpur and Aerocity to Tughlaqabad — have a combined length of 61.66km. According to DMRC estimates, the cost of constructing these three corridors would be around Rs 29,000 crore, sources said.At present, DMRC is finishing work on Phase III, which is expected to be wrapped up by June this year. The agency wants to start construction of Phase IV before work on Phase III finishes so that the manpower and machinery present at the sites can be used without any break. “Once Phase III is complete and there is a delay in starting work on Phase IV, men and machinery would have to be mobilised again resulting in further delay and cost overrun,” an official said.DMRC wants to avoid this situation and this is one of the primary reasons why it wants to start work on at least three of the six proposed corridors. Work on the other three corridors can be started later. The agency expects to take five years to complete the entire project from the date of commencement of construction work.Though the approval is still pending, DMRC has started preparatory work on Phase IV as it will help start construction as soon as the go-ahead comes.It is going to rope in architectural firms to finalise designs of stations and viaducts on the sections which include Inderlok to Indraprastha, Majlis Park to RK Ashram, Janakpuri West to RK Ashram, Rithala to Narela, Janakpuri to Majlis Park, Majlis Park to Maujpur, Tughlaqabad to Saket, Saket to IGI Airport and Lajpat Nagar to Saket G-Block.The geo-technical survey at different sites where stations of Phase IV are planned has already been started. DMRC sources said that preparatory works don’t involve major expenditure, but help make up for some time lost due to delays in getting approvals.The proposal sent by DMRC to the housing and urban affairs ministry doesn’t mention anything about Delhi government’s commitment for funding. Sources said this will pose a serious problem in sanctioning of the project. However, there are indications that the Centre may consider approving the plan to send the message that the Union government is keen to push development works.',\n",

He wanted to be the first to see it and show his son the “amazing sight”.

Rehman also cleared doubts of young students. He said it was a blue moon because a full moon was seen twice a month, and a red moon because of the copper colour visible to the naked eye.Friends Divyanshi and Rahul turned up at the venue just after class. The college students felt that seeing something as rare as the blue moon would be a very exciting experience.Many were seen with cameras and their own telescopes as the queues were too long.

I am not sure if it is time to throw our gates open to each and every refugee to come and stay in India.

However, even that was postponed due to unavailability of police force.Chambers of Traders and Industry president Brijesh Goyal said that about 750 market associations will keep their markets shut for three days from Friday, against the ongoing sealing drive.“We have been trying to meet the monitoring committee members, Delhi government and municipal corporation officials to seek relaxation but nothing has happened. About 750 traders associations will keep their markets shut for three consecutive days as a sign of protest,” said Goyal.Meanwhile chief minister Arvind Kejriwal met LG Anil Baijal on Wednesday and discussed the issue of ongoing sealing. Baijal has informed the CM that all possiblities are being explored, in view of judicial pronouncements and laws. CM said that the LG assured him that some solution would be found soon.',\n",

She is currently convalescing in BK Hospital in Old Faridabad area while the cops are pursuing the men who put her through a traumatic two years.The teenager was brought to Delhi from Godda district in Jharkhand two years ago by a man named Surender. She told TOI that her prolonged nightmare started the day she lost her parents in a road accident. “Since there was no one to care of me and my brothers, my grandmother shifted to our house,” she sobbed. “She treated us badly and finally sold me to Surender for Rs 4,000.”The girl was hopeful of a better life in Delhi, but she alleged she was continually subjected to sexual assault by Surender, who has evaded police arrest since Sunday, the day she revealed her tale to the cops. “He thrashed me and raped me the moment we stepped into his house. However, when he wanted me hired by a couple in Delhi, he did not beat me for some days so I would not appear bruised and battered.”The time she spent as a maid at the couple’s house was the only happy time she has had in the past two years. But that happiness was short lived. “Surender got his friend, Mani Mishra, to employ me when my contract at the Delhi house ended,” the survivor said.Mishra took her home to Dheeraj Nagar in Faridabad and, the girl claimed, the moment they entered his house, he took away the Rs 30,000 she had earned at the Delhi house. He then raped her in the kitchen even as his wife and two children stood outside. This became a routine. Convulsed in tears, the survivor mumbled, “Mishra was ten times worse than Surender. He always threatened me with a red kitchen knife, and gagged me if I resisted or tried to scream. He tied my legs and burnt them with cigarettes if I tried to free myself.”For days at stretch, she was confined to the kitchen at Mishra’s house. The only time she caught a glimpse of Mishra’s children was when she used the washroom. Frail and traumatised, she finally made a bid for freedom on Sunday. Two youths found her, eyes swollen, clothes tattered and body bleeding and covered with polythene bags. She managed to communicate to them her predicament through sign language.The youngsters took her to the police station where a case was registered under the Indian Penal Code IPC, Juvenile Justice Act and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act.

The driver of the cab was found to be the mastermind. He was tracked down and arrested from Meethapur in southeast Delhi. One of the robbers is an HR manager with an apparel company based in Noida.The victim, Kaushal Kumar Sharma, had gone to Okhla to deposit money in a bank. He reached Maa Anandamayee Marg around 8.15pm and was waiting for an autorickshaw to head back home when the cabbie, Rehan Khan, stopped his vehicle and offered Sharma a ride for Rs 20, DCP (south-east) Chinmoy Biswal said.Sharma said two men, later identified as Ranjan Singh and Ravi Shankar Sharma, were sitting in the car. They forced him to sit between them and after travelling 200-300 metres one of them pulled out a knife and held it against Sharma’s throat.Instead of going towards Badarpur, Khan took a turn towards Kalkaji and drove to Saket. On the way, they forced Sharma to hand over his laptop, mobile phone and Rs 4,650 in cash. They stopped at a desolate spot near G-Block in Saket and pushed him out. The victim then lodged a police complaint.“A team led by SHO (Okhla) Mukesh Walia tracked down the cab owner with the help of the partial numberplate noted down by the complainant. Details of more than 20 cars were scanned before zeroing in on the right vehicle. Khan was caught after the owner, Naveen Jha, identified him from the description provided by Sharma,” said Biswal.Jha said that he had hired Khan on January 1 to drive the vehicle with a cab-aggregator service. Singh and Ravi were caught after Khan gave their whereabouts to the cops. Khan lived in Meethapur with Singh and Ravi and used to work in an export company in Noida as an unskilled labourer.He took to crime as he was not earning enough to meet his needs.

In fact, of the Rs 1,800 crore revenue target set for FY18, he said the company expects Rs 600 crore from international operations and Rs 1,200 crore from Indian operations. As part of its growing international ambitions, REEL has already acquired 50% stake in Texas-based marine pollution management services provider Nature Environmental Marine Services (NEMS) making Ramky the first Indian player to foray into this niche segment, Reddy said. Though he refused to divulge the size of the acquisition, he said NEMS does a business of about $5-6 million per annum and REEL may explore the possibility of acquiring the balance equity in the US company in the future.Back home in India, it has a 48MW waste to energy plant coming up at Jawaharnagar in Hyderabad at a cost of Rs 330-340 crore on a BOT (build own transfer) basis. “The first phase of the plant, 20 MW, is under construction after various hurdles and is expected to become operational by February-March 2019,” he said.',\n",

       " \"NEW DELHI: If you missed peak winter chill this January, here’s the reason why. In the absence of adequate rain and snow in north India, the average day temperature during the month was 1.7 degrees higher than normal, making it the warmest January in Delhi in 12 years if day conditions are considered.The average maximum temperature in January this year was a warm 22.2 degrees Celsius, with day temperatures remaining higher than normal on as many as 23 days of the month. The city last saw warmer daytime conditions in January in 2006, when the average maximum was slightly higher at 22.4 degrees C, the warmest in 25 year.This year, therefore, saw the second warmest day conditions in January in a quarter century.“There was just a single spell of rain and snow in north India during the entire month whereas three wet spells are normal. As a result, we had mainly clear skies over Delhi this January, which raised day temperatures,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s Regional Weather Forecasting Centre here.The absence of snow also meant that winds sweeping in from the north weren’t the usual icy northwesterlies that bring chill into the region, Srivastava said.A look at weather conditions in recent years tells the story of just how warm the past month was. In 2015, for instance, the average maximum January temperature was 17.9 degrees C, more than 4 notches below this year's average. In the past two Januarys, which too were warmer than normal, the average maximums were 21.6 and 21.1 degrees C, respectively. The coldest January in the past 25 years (in terms of day conditions) was in 2003, when the average maximum was just 17.6 degrees C.However, nights were far from warm this January. The clear skies that raised day temperatures during the month allowed heat to dissipate into the atmosphere at night, making nights colder than normal.The average minimum temperature was a shade lower than 7 degrees C, around 0.5 degrees below normal. In fact, it was the lowest average minimum temperature in January in five years.“The nights were mostly clear and hence cold. Northerly winds blew for most of the month. While these helped keep temperatures low, the winds were not chilly enough for extreme cold conditions to set in,” Srivastava said.The lowest temperature during the month was 4.2 degrees C on January 6. By contrast, the lowest January temperature in recent years was 1.9 degrees C, recorded on January 18, 2013.\",\n",
       " 'NEW DELHI: The rape of an eight-month-old infant in the capital has only shown a disturbing trend of child sexual assaults where most perpetrators are either family members or known to the victim. Legal experts say most victims belong to the lower strata of the society, and though the children tend to get rehabilitated early while growing up, the mental scars are extremely tough to identify.In 2016, of the total 1,374 sexual offences against children in Delhi, 724 were of rape and resulted in 739 victims. In the same year, 657 cases of crimes against children went to trial of which 377 resulted in either acquittal or discharge. There were merely 280 convictions at a rate of less than 50%.A judge, who has dealt with POCSO cases earlier, said children are vulnerable. “And a mature person committing such crimes is diabolical. What we have to look at are the various factors behind the crime,” the judge said.He said the free flow of drugs and pornography have hugely impacted the psyche of the perpetrators. “Poverty has its own vicious cycle and children who go through the trauma realise it later only to lose trust in elders,” he added.Delhi Police had filed a status report in 2014-15, informing the Delhi high court that they had done a survey in the city and found 58 police stations spread over seven or eight districts where such cases were mostly registered. The report also showed cases where even schoolchildren were found to be involved in harassment.Advocate Chandra Suman has appeared in over 300 cases of child sexual assault cases in the last nine years. He stresses that minors between five and six years of age are more vulnerable. “I am sure there is another disturbing aspect to the case of the eight-month-old,” said Suman.In such cases, Suman said, children cannot disclose their ordeal as they lack the ability to differentiate between right and wrong. He said in the present case, there is no eyewitness, which only shows that a child’s safety is of prime concern in such households where most parents leave their kids in the company of other people.“Anganwadi centres should be set up in the cities and the fringes where parents work as daily wage-earners. These centres can look after their children when parents are not around,” Suman added.For advocate Pankaj Ranga, his tenure as a public prosecutor in a court dealing with POCSO cases made him aware of the background of most such offenders. When he was prosecuting such criminals, he saw the psychology of the victims being affected in the long run. For them, he said, it was extremely painful to face the case. “To remind the child during examination of evidence is a difficult job, especially when the sequence of the crime is reiterated,” he said.Ranga, who now prosecutes drug abusers, suggests sensitisation of parents and other family members.Another legal expert, who has been a judge, felt that trauma is severe in majority of cases when children show signs of it. In such cases, he said, counselling is important for their early rehabilitation. A Delhi State Legal Services Authority (DSLSA) member informed that in such cases stage-wise help is given to victims in need and could be provided with a lawyer, counselling and monetary compensation. “The court in this case has directed for compensation and we will sanction it,” he said.DSLSA member secretary and judge Sanjeev Jain said, “Students need to be taught in schools about gender equality and conditioned to choose right from wrong.”',\n",

He said that the harassment started when he was in the same section with the accused in Class VIII. “They would scare me with blades and ask me to keep my mouth shut or they would kill me. They would continue to assault me even when I complained of pain,” the boy said.The accused would ensure that Shivam remained in constant fear by harassing him on his way home from school. For close to two years, the accused would bully Shivam inside the school, wait for him outside the school gates in the afternoon and then drag him to the park near the school to sodomise him.The boy’s family observed his behaviour changing as he became reclusive. “He would not step out of the house and stopped playing with other children. He would give excuses for not going to school saying that he had already studied the lesson at the tuition centre,” the boy’s grandmother said. He also underwent a check-up by a local doctor for loss of appetite, but no one could figure out what was bothering him.On Tuesday, when the teacher took him to the staff room, the boy started crying. He asked the teacher to accompany him home otherwise the accused boys would do “bad things” with him in the park. After Shivam narrated his ordeal, a teacher escorted him to his house and told his mother to keep him home for a few days.“The teacher didn’t give us a reason and just asked us to send Shivam’s father to the school,” the boy’s uncle said.

A bench of acting chief justice Gita Mittal and Justice C Hari Shankar asked the authorities, including PWD, to file a reply by February 16.The PIL was filed by residents of South Extension who raised the issue of reducing the size of the road from 60 feet to 15 feet due to the construction of Metro station at INA.Earlier this month, TOI had highlighted that PWD wrote to DMRC saying that the structure — at the intersection of the Chandu Lal Balmiki Road and Aurobindo Road — has encroached upon the arterial road connecting Aurobindo Road with South Extension Part-I and NBCC’s Kidwai Nagar project.

       " 'NEW DELHI: The drive to Gurgaon for the distinctive sip of freshly brewed beer will end for Delhiites, with the first microbrewery readying to open in the heart of the city. After the technical hurdle holding up the opening of microbreweries in Delhi was cleared by the lieutenant governor in December, a restobar in Connaught Place may soon start plying house-brewed beer to customers.The CP restaurant\\'s application to begin microbrewery operations has cleared the scrutiny hurdles at the excise department, though the Delhi Pollution Control Committee is likely to carry out an assessment next week to determine if such a set-up contributes to pollution. Three applications were received by the excise department, but only Ministry of Beer is going ahead, with the other two having removed their installations as uncertainty prevailed over the government’s policy on microbreweries.Those who understand the science of beer making say there is a big difference between bottled beer and fresh brew. For one, the bottled variety comes sealed with preservatives and chemicals, while on-tap beer is purer. Also, each outlet can experiment with the malts and flavours it can offer, giving customers a wider choice. An owner of a restobar who preferred anonymity added, \"You not only get freshly brewed beer with no additives, but a pitcher of it costs less than a bottle too.\"Delhi excise commissioner Amjad Tak told TOI, “When one brewery opens, others too will come forward. There is a huge demand for freshly brewed beer and currently people have to go to Gurgaon for this.” The closest availability to such libation till now was Haryana, which has 45 microbreweries, most of them in Gurgaon.Delhi government sees microbreweries as a good source of revenue. Establishments will be levied according to daily installed capacity. Ministry of Beer has a capacity to produce 200 litres a day. Excise data shows that beer is in big demand in summer, with restaurants often facing a shortage of the sought-after beer brands. Realising the revenue potential, Delhi government changed policy to allow microbreweries in the capital, but only in December did the LG approve of it after such installations were moved out of the \"prohibited\" category of Delhi Development Authority\\'s Master Plan 2021.National Restaurant Association of India estimates the market in India for in-house brews at Rs 10,000 crore. However, investors will be careful, given that installing a brewery is expensive and requires around 1,000 square metres of space.',\n",

The infant is admitted to a hospital in North Delhi.“We direct that two competent doctors from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) shall go along with special ambulance to the hospital in question and, thereafter, take a decision whether the child can be shifted to AIIMS to have better care and treatment. For the said purpose, we leave it to the two doctors, who are the experts in the field, but the doctors concerned must appreciate the concern expressed by this court,” the bench said.The court took cognisance of the case after advocate Alakh Alok Srivastava brought to its notice the heinous crime. The matter was mentioned before the bench in the morning and the court agreed to hear the case after lunch and sought assistance of the additional solicitor general. The court also asked secretary or any other person in-charge of Delhi Legal Services Authority to accompany the doctors.The apex court also reminded the government of its previous order asking it to make law for stringent punishment in sexual harassment cases against minor girls. “We are disposed to think so as by that age, a child, a glorious gift to mankind, cannot conceive of any kind of carnal desire in man. Once she becomes a victim of such a crime, there is disastrous effect on her mind. The mental agony lasts long. Sorrow and fear haunt forever. There is need to take steps for stopping this kind of child abuse and hence, possibly there is a need for defining the term child in the context of rape and thereafter provide for more severe punishment in respect of the culprits who are involved in this type of crime. In the light of the said decision, we part with the suggestion with the fond hope that Parliament would respond to the agony of the collective, for it really deserves consideration. We say no more on this score,” it said while referring to its earlier order.The infant was allegedly raped by her 28-year-old cousin in Shakurbasti in northwest Delhi on Sunday. The child had suffered severe injuries to her vital organs and was put on ventilator and she had to undergo several surgeries.As per the police report, the infant was sexually assaulted after her parents left her to the care of the mother of the accused as they had to go to work. The child stayed on the first floor of the house with her parents while the family of accused lives on the ground floor. Police said the youth took the child to a room on the top floor of the house on the pretext of playing with her and sexually assaulted her. He had gagged the child's mouth so that her cries were inaudible.The child's mother works as a maid nearby. When she returned home at night, she found the child crying and bleeding from her genitals profusely. She immediately rushed her to the hospital where doctors confirmed sexual assault and informed police. When the youth was questioned, he denied having done anything. But soon after, he fled from the house, which confirmed police's suspicion about his involvement. He was later arrested.\",\n",
       " 'NEW DELHI: In an unusual and unprecedented step, Delhi assembly Speaker Ram Niwas Goel on Wednesday said at a press conference that LG Anil Baijal had “violated the conduct of the constitutional office and Indian culture” by not giving him time for a meeting despite written and telephonic requests from the Speaker’s secretariat in the first week of January. The Speaker wanted a meeting with the LG to convey his New Year greetings. Goel said that he easily gets appointments with the President and Lok Sabha Speaker for courtesy calls but not from the LG.The Speaker finally wrote a letter to him on January 10 to convey his greetings. “The LG reciprocated on January 23 by writing a letter in which he did not express any regret for not meeting me,” he said.The Speaker sent another letter to the LG on Wednesday in which he said it was painful to see AAP legislators struggling to get time from his office for meeting him – on January 29, a group of AAP MLAs waited for over four hours outside Raj Niwas before they got the opportunity to meet the LG to discuss the ongoing sealing drive. Goel said that it was, however, very easy for the four BJP MLAs to meet the LG. He alleged that the “conduct of the LG is not adding dignity to his office.”Calling the LG as “de facto leader of the Opposition”, the letter says “reports of MLAs, ministers and even the chief minister not being granted an audience by the LG are becoming frequent.”Despite repeated attempts by TOI, there was no response from the LG’s office till late in the night.Meanwhile, the Speaker reiterated that there was no question of removing the portrait of Tipu Sultan from the gallery of the assembly. BJP MLA Manjinder Singh Sirsa has said that Tipu Sultan was a \"traitor\" and his portrait would not be allowed to be put up in the assembly.“It is the habit of BJP to create controversy. Tipu Sultan was a patriot and his portrait will continue to adorn the assembly’s gallery,” Goel said. He warned of strict action if anybody removed Tipu’s portrait. A CCTV camera has been installed near the portrait to deter any such act. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had on Republic Day unveiled portraits of 70 freedom fighters, including Tipu’s, in the assembly.',\n",
       " 'NEW DELHI: A Delhi court on Wednesday upheld the conviction of the principal and director of a private school concurring with an earlier order that not letting a child enter the classroom or have lunch with friends amounts to “will neglect” and causes “mental suffering”.Additional Sessions Judge Vikas Dhull upheld the trial court judgment of July 2017 that had held the duo guilty under Section 23 (cruelty to juvenile or child) of Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection) Act, 2000, besides directing them to pay compensation of Rs 2.5 lakh each.The lawyers associated with the case, Chandra Suman and Zishaan Iskandari, told TOI that the sessions court, however, modified the two-month sentence and directed the appellants to be released on probation for six months.“The appellants are now required to appear before the probation officer, Dwarka district, every month for the next six months. Based on the probation officer’s report and upon information of commission of similar or any other offence by them, the trial court shall be at liberty to impose the sentence,” the lawyers said.In his complaint, the student’s father, Dr N Raghuram, had alleged that his daughter was “ill-treated” and confined by the management throughout school hours on April 24, 2012, to pressure her guardians to withdraw her. He had added that the school’s conduct was the result of queries raised by him about uniforms and accessories during the orientation programme.The school authorities, on the other hand, said that the student was given a transfer certificate (TC) on April 23, 2012 on the request of her parents. However, instead of collecting the TC they sent their daughter to school the next day. The child was apparently “not feeling comfortable” after coming to school and since she was an asthma patient she was sent to the infirmary.The girl, who is 12 years old now, has moved on, but was disheartened as she was unable to say goodbye to her friends, the parent said.Initially, Raghuram had filed a complaint with Child Welfare Committee. Later, police filed a chargesheet under Section 23 of JJ Act.',\n",
       " 'MUMBAI: On Saturday, three blues bands battled it out at the True School of Music for a chance to perform at the upcoming Mahindra Blues Festival. The Kolkata-based band, Arinjoy Trio, won over the judges with their musicianship and feel for the blues. “When we heard them playing the first song, we knew this guy (Arinjoy) was a pro,” said music director Ehsaan Noorani, who picked the winners, along with music director Loy Mendonsa. “He can play in a blues festival anywhere in the world. He is so good,” said Noorani.Led by guitarist Arinjoy Sarkar, the three-year-old band has Sounak Roy on drums and Aakash Ganguly on bass—the three musicians who, as Ganguly puts it, “started speaking the same language”. “It’s a dream come true to play at a prestigious festival like this,” said Sarkar, “especially in front of so many blues greats that we love and worship.”This year’s Band Hunt received 30 entries from across the country. Besides Arinjoy Trio, the final round saw live performances by The Mojo Hand, a blues band from Bengaluru with influences from Chicago and Delta styles, and Submarine in Space, an instrumental rock project who performs old school jazz to Hindustani Classical, based out of Delhi.“Year after year, the Mahindra Blues Band Hunt gives bands across the country a platform to showcase their talent,” said Mendonsa. “This year was no different; we had three technically proficient bands perform unique and soulful music. It was a tough decision for us to select one winner.”Having won the Band Hunt, Arinjoy Trio will perform on the second day of the Mahindra Blues Festival—Asia’s largest blues festival to be held on February 10 and 11. The festival’s star-studded line-up includes the Godfather of British Blues’, John Mayall; the original Wolfman who combines rhythm and blues, Walter ‘Wolfman’ Washington; astounding blues-rock guitar virtuoso, Coco Montaya; magical powerhouse, Layla Zoe; and local Mumbai-bred band, Blackstratblues. Noorani and Mendonsa plan to catch Arinjoy Trio’s performance at the fest.Arinjoy Trio picked numbers with different tempos like ‘Sky is crying’ by Elmore James—which they dedicated to The Mojo Hand, because they are big fans of the guitarist—and an original ‘Cold Cold Cold’ and ‘Honey Hush’ by Albert Collins. After the performance, the judges praised Arinjoy Trio’s ability to connect with the audience and each other through eye contact and other non-verbal cues. “The main thing is you have fun,” said Noorani, “and it’s always good to share that fun with everyone else on stage.”The point of the Band Hunt is to discover “raw blues talent”, said Jay Shah, head of cultural outreach at Mahindra & Mahindra. And, the judges find it heartening to hear these young musicians every year. “It’s fantastic to see the new generation, which is completely ruled by pop, playing this kind of music,” said Noorani.(The Mahindra Blues Festival in association with The Times of India is co-sponsored by The Glenlivet Books, Gledo & Mahindra Finance. The festival is promoted and produced by Oranjuice Entertainment. Tickets available on bookmyshow.com)',\n",
       " 'MUMBAI: With Mahashivratri falling on February 13, a prominent temple at Chheda Nagar in Chembur has organized an elaborate dance festival in honour of Lord Shiva from February 1-13. Another name for Lord Shiva is Natraj, and this annual event is named Natyanjali, literally an offering of dance.Senior dancers guided or inspired by gurus like Darshana Jhaveri (Manipuri), Asha Joglekar (Kathak), Kanak Rele (Mohiniattam), Rajee Narayanan (Bharatanatyam), Chitra Visweswaran (Bharatanatyam) and Gopinathan Nair (Kathakali) will perform.The Sri Subramania Samaj temple has been organizing this cultural extravaganza since 2005. P S Subramanian of the Samaj said, “We drew inspiration from the famous dance festival at Chidambaram temple in Tamil Nadu. Over time, hundreds of dancers and troupes began to perform in the run-up to Mahashivratri. Slowly, Shiva temples across South India adopted a tradition of hosting dance festivals on this occasion, and we thought of doing so in Mumbai.”Natyanjali has grown from a three-day programme to a 13-day event this season. “Initially, we allotted time slots of one hour to individual artistes, but have now reduced it to 20 minutes given the vast number of performers. Participants arrive from all parts of the country as well as abroad,” Subramanian said.The highlight of the opening day, on Thursday, is Nruttamaalika, a garland of various genres, including Bharatanatyam, Kathak, Mohiniattam and Kuchipudi, all performed by expert teachers. “Most have been training students for decades, some of them run their own institutes,” said Jayashree Nair, herself a teacher since 42 years. Nair has composed the act and is the nodal coordinator for Natyanjali artistes worldwide. Bragha Bessel, a senior Bhartanatyam exponent from Tamil Nadu, will perform the same day.“We are practising for the group show for up to 10 hours, and are rather particular about attendance. We would have included Sattriya performers from Odisha too, but they were unable to arrive for rehearsal. Yet, there is always next year,” Nair said.On the final day, 50 of the best gurus will perform individually for five minutes each. There are two weekends before February 13, and each has up to 14 performances.',\n",

As such, all adjudication work will remain shut till March 12, at least when the NGT bar association’s petition comes up for a hearing before the apex court.The SC bench of Chief Justice Dipak Misra, Justice A M Khanwilkar and Justice D Y Chandrachud was hearing a petition by the NGT Bar Association (western region) challenging the NGT (Practices and Procedures) Amendment Rules 2017 that allowed even a single member bench to perform judicial functions. The ministry of environment, forest and climate change; registrar general of NGT principal bench; registrar of NGT Pune bench; and the ministry of law and justice are respondents.There is an overall provision for 40 members at the NGT benches in Delhi, Pune, Bhopal, Kolkata and Chennai. Of these, 34 posts for judicial and expert members are vacant at the regional benches, including Pune’s. As of now, only four judicial members and two expert members are functioning.Petitioner Saurabh Kulkarni, who heads NGT Bar Association (western region), told TOI, “We have challenged the amended rules of 2017 and a consequential office order by the NGT chairperson on December 5, 2017, on the grounds that the same are ultra vires (beyond one’s legal power/authority) and contrary to the parent statute—the NGT Act, 2010 which does not envisage constitution of single member bench for adjudication of disputes.”',\n",
       " 'NEW DELHI: In a big relief to over 42,000 homebuyers who have invested in real estate giant Amrapali, the Supreme Court on Tuesday asked the company to frame a comprehensive plan in a week for completion of its housing projects.The top court told homebuyers that it will ensure they get their flats and money refunded only in cases where the project is unviable. Unlike Jaypee and Unitech housing projects where the SC is making efforts to ensure homebuyers get their money back, the court noted that most buyers in Amrapali projects are from middle-class families, who invested life-long savings for a home. They must be given possession of their flats, said the bench comprising Justices Arun Mishra and Amitava Roy.As Amrapali failed to give possession of flats and its sister firm faces insolvency proceedings, the Supreme Court decided to intervene to protect the interests of homebuyers.The bench said homebuyers need protection as the developer had diverted their money to buy assets, which could be auctioned by the creditor bank to recover its loan, leaving investors vulnerable and without hope of either getting a home or a refund. “People invested savings of their lifetime in buying the flats and their interests cannot be neglected,” the bench said.The court was hearing a batch of petitions filed by over 100 flat-buyers who had booked homes in Amrapali’s various projects in Noida and Greater Noida, including Amrapali Centurion Park-Low Rise project, Amrapali Centurion Park-Terrace Homes and Amrapali Centurion Park-Tropical Garden. They approached the court after National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) initiated Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process and the tribunal restrained the company from transferring or disposing of its assets on a plea of Bank of Baroda which had given a loan to the company.“The Amrapali firms were found in serious breach of their obligation to deliver the flats within 36 months, that is by 2013 and in some cases it is 2016,” advocate M L Lahoty, appearing for one group of homebuyers, said.Senior advocate Ranjit Kumar, appearing for the company, said structures in most of the projects had been completed and possession will be handed over in a phased manner and completed by 2020.The bench, after hearing all the sides, said it would examine their plea project-wise as a common order for all buyers would create further confusion and be counter productive. It asked the company to file a plan after consulting with Committee of Creditors and Insolvency Resolution Professional (IRP).',\n",
       " 'MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Wednesday asked Mumbai traffic police to spell out if they had any plans to tackle traffic congestion in the crowded Kalbadevi neighbourhood. A division bench of Justices Naresh Patil and Nitin Sambre suggested police could declare specific times as “pedestrian-only” or increase parking rates.The high court was hearing a public interest litigation filed by resident Rajkumar Shukla on traffic congestion in Kalbadevi, a popular shopping area comprising Crawford Market, Chira Bazaar, Princess Street and other streets. The HC bench said it was not satisfied with the affidavit that the traffic police had filed regarding measures taken to ease the situation.“Placing two constables on each street is not a plan,” said Justice Patil. The judge pointed out that the neighbourhood was located just across the street from the headquarters of the Mumbai police commissioner.“The area housing your police commissioner should be the best and most disciplined area in Mumbai. But the reality is different. Drawing up a proper plan means making proposals for underground and multi-storey car parking, restricting vehicle timings, ensuring footpaths are clear and pedestrians have place to walk and shoppers have proper access,” said the judge.Justice Sambre remarked traffic constables are often seen talking on their mobile phones.The bench directed the petitioner to add the BMC as a party in the case. It asked the traffic police to hold a meeting with shop owners in the area to work out a proper traffic management plan.Advocate S R Patel, counsel for the petitioner, pointed out cars and bikes were carelessly parked on narrow roads in the neighbourhood. “There is double and even triple parking on the roads. There have already been a few incidents where ambulances and emergency vehicles were stuck and could not reach on time,” said advocate Patel. The HC bench has scheduled further hearing of the case on February 16, when it has listed other petitions about traffic problems in Mumbai for hearing.',\n",
       " 'NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday expressed concern over the interests of homebuyers being neglected in insolvency proceedings against real estate companies and slammed Interim Resolution Professional (IRP) in the case against Amrapali group for harassing flat buyers and demanding rest of the money due to the builder.A bench of Justices Arun Mishra and Amitava Roy said that homebuyers’ stake could not be compromised to protect the interests of creditor banks in insolvency proceedings and charged IRP with taking side of Amrapali group and neglecting the grievances of flat-buyers.As the investment made by homebuyers has been put at the bottom in the priority list in insolvency proceedings, they could be refunded only after banks recovered their dues after selling the assets of the company, making the position of buyers vulnerable in such proceedings. The buyers are left with no option but to approach court to protect their interests.The IRP has taken over the affairs of Amrapali after National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) admitted the insolvency proceedings initiated by Bank of Baroda against the firm on September 4 last year.With the homebuyers in Amrapali projects complaining to the bench that they are being forced to make payment of the remaining amount by IPR without giving assurance of handing over of their booked flats, the court restrained IPR from demanding from buyers.Senior advocate Gaurab Banerji, appearing for IRP, said around Rs 21 crore was needed for installing the fire safety equipment in the flats already handed over to buyers in the Silicon City project of the Amrapali group.He said the developer has only Rs 1.5 crore in its bank account due to which it was not possible to manage the affairs.“You are worried about liquidating all assets of the company but our worry is about homebuyers,” the bench said and directed the company to install fire safety equipment within a month.',\n",
       " 'MUMBAI: Even after spending time behind bars for allegedly stealing a wallet from actor Karisma Kapoor’s Khar residence last year, a carpenter from Kurla, Imtiaz Ansari (37), went back to his old ways.Recently, two complaints were filed against Ansari for allegedly stealing valuables collectively worth Rs 16 lakh from the Juhu residences of a businessman and a celebrity. Juhu police got Ansari’s number and an informant called him up pretending he urgently wanted some carpentry work done in his house. When Ansari said he could not come for a week, police realized he wasn’t in Mumbai. A team went to his home town in Uttar Pradesh and arrested him. He was brought to Mumbai on Tuesday.Explaining his modus operandi, police said Ansari would make calls on the landline number of people living in the western suburbs asking if they needed the services of a carpenter. He would offer to do small jobs like fixing a door handle or a broken latch, which other carpenters usually avoid as it does not pay much. When a houseowner would call him over, Ansari would examine the work and say he had to buy some items like nails. He would take Rs 200-Rs 500 from the houseowner and leave to buy the items. On his return, the houseowner would be assured of his honesty, said police.While doing the carpentry work, when the houseowner would not be looking, Ansari would pocket whatever he would lay his hands on. “If the owner kept a watch on him, Ansari would claim that the entrance door wasn’t functioning properly and should be tested from the outside. Once the owner stepped out to check the door, Ansari would steal valuables,” said assistant inspector Rahul Deshmukh. And, if anyone asked for a reference, he would provide the addresses of flats where he could not steal anything, police said.Ansari has at least 18 similar cases registered against him at police stations in Khar, Amboli, Bandra, Borivli, Juhu, Santacruz, Versova and Vile Parle.',\n",
       " 'MUMBAI: In special circumstances, foreign or NRI adoptive parents can be directed to submit a deposit and make investments in the name of the adopted child, the Bombay high court has ruled in an important order. Justice Suresh Gupte said ordinarily the court would not require such deposits and investments to be made before allowing foreign adoptions.The court was called upon to clarify the issue by an adoption agency in light of the 2017 Adoption Regulations that had specified that foreign nationals no longer needed to submit the deposit or investments.The Central Adoption Resource Authority that regulates inter-country adoptions had also made a representation to the high court urging it to withdraw the condition.As per the practice laid down by the courts, a foreign national intending to adopt an Indian child has to deposit Rs 60,000 and invest around Rs 3.5 lakh in the child’s name. For Indian parents, the investment amount is Rs 1 lakh.“Of course, ordinarily the court shall not ask the adoptive parents to execute any bond or make any investments in the name of the child...For special reasons and with a view to enforce compliance with any special conditions depending upon the exigencies of the case, the court may use its discretion and insist on any condition, including execution of a bond or deposit,” said the judge.The practice of deposits and investments in the name of the child was based on a 1991 Supreme Court order in a public interest litigation about malpractices in foreign adoptions. At that time, foreigners could only be appointed as guardians and the adoption formalities had to be completed in their respective countries. According to the high court, “bond money was insisted upon with a view to ensure it would facilitate repatriation of the child in case the adoption did not go through in that country and it became necessary to bring the child back to India.”However, in 2015, the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act was enacted which allows foreign couples to adopt Indian children. The new regulations also allow for monitoring of the children and regular reports being filed about the adopted children.',\n",

API is defined as the confirmed cases of vector-borne diseases in one year per thousand population.According to the figures, Gujarat recorded 37,028 cases of malaria with an API of 0.57 of malaria till November this year.Whereas the BIMARU states, Bihar (2,977), Madhya Pradesh (36,242), Rajasthan (6,549) and Uttar Pradesh (31,162) reported less cases than Gujarat in 2017.Apart from Madhya Pradesh, the other three BIMARU states registered fewer malaria cases than Gujarat since 2014.If the figures of last four years are compared, then it can be seen that there is no decline in malaria cases as the cases ranged between 41,608 to 44,783 from 2014 to 2016. In the BIMARU states, the API remains between 0.01 to 1.26 between 2014 and 2017. In 2017, the country has recorded 7,93,548 cases of malaria which comprises 4% cases from Gujarat.It needs mention that the World Malaria Report 2016 said that India contributed 89% of the incidence of malaria in the South-East Asia region. The Union health ministry also released its vision for ridding the country of malaria by the year 2027 and of eliminating the disease by the year 2030.A report on malaria’s epidemiological situation of the entire country found that of positive malaria cases reported, 15% were from falciparum.',\n",

       " 'PATNA: Former Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) professor Anand Kumar on Wednesday called for drastic reforms in the election and party system in the country.Delivering a lecture on ‘Cultural pluralism, social cohesion and development’ to mark the 60th foundation day of A N Sinha Institute of Social Studies (ANSISS), the sociologist urged people to “aim for harmonious and sustainable development through cultural pluralism and social cohesion”.While cultural pluralism occurs when smaller groups maintain their unique cultural identities within a larger society, social cohesion is the willingness of the members of a society to cooperate with each other in order to survive together and prosper.Talking about the connection between religious harmony and communal strife, Kumar said, “Both Ashoka and Akbar represented cultural pluralism and religious harmony. Shashank and Aurangzeb, on the other hand, were infamous for their religious intolerance and cultural discriminations. The Britishers were also blamed for adopting the policy of divide and rule and conspiring with communal forces for the partition of India.”India’s civilizational journey has been complex with several twists and turns. Recalling novelist V S Naipaul’s notion of post-independent India, Kumar highlighted three important phases between 1947 and 1990. “The country looked like ‘an area of darkness’ in the first decade after independence and like ‘a wounded civilization’ in the mid-70s or during the Emergency period. During the 90s, there was an atmosphere of ‘million mutinies’,” he said.Deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi, state education minister Krishna Nandan Prasad Verma, ANSISS director Sunil Ray and registrar Nil Ratan, among others, also attended the lecture.',\n",

Bihar Chamber of Commerce and Industries president P K Agarwal said investment in road, communication and gas pipeline will boost growth.Some industrialists are also expecting special package or incentive for the state. Bihar Industries Association president KPS Keshri said he expects industrial development fund for backward regions of the country, which will also benefit Bihar. Both Agarwal and Keshri said they were expecting special package or extra incentive for the state development.Farmers have also expectations from the Centre regarding lower interest rate on loans to buy modern machineries and boost the agricultural sector.Sudhanshu Kumar of Nayanagar under Hasanpur block in Samastipur district said the farm loan is capped at Rs1 lakh and given at 7% interest. Farmers get 3% rebate on timely repayment. He said the cap should be increased to at least Rs3 lakh as most of the machines were costly. He also wants interest rate to be reduced to 5% with 3% rebate on timely repayment of loan. “Instead of waiving the loan, the government should reduce the interest rate,” he said.Middle-class and salaried people hope the income tax slab will be increased from Rs2.50 lakh to Rs3 lakh. Increase in the slab for tax saving schemes like life insurance, employees’ provident fund and public provident fund is another expectation. Aditi Mishra (29) of a telecom company said people could save income tax on investments up to Rs1.5 lakh only. It should be at least Rs2 lakh, she said and added that women should be given extra relaxation in terms of tax slab to empower them.Kanchan Roy, a homemaker residing in Shivpuri, expects the government to control the LPG cylinder price. “The LPG cylinder price is increasing every day. Right now, I am paying Rs813 for one cylinder, which was around Rs600 only a few months back,” she said. Roy even demanded reduction in GST on sari and readymade garments.',\n",
       " 'PATNA: Cloudy sky and dense fog on Wednesday evening prevented stargazers in Patna from catching a glimpse of the so-called ‘supermoon’.Patnaites thronged the Shri Krishna Science Centre (SKSC) to watch the big moon through digital telescope. However, the fog and cloud played spoilsport in viewing the lunar eclipse which was to be seen in the city sky from 6.21pm to 7.37pm. A detailed presentation was screened through a projector to make the visitors aware about the lunar eclipse. However, hundreds of people participated in the ‘Selfie with the Supermoon’ event at the SKSC.St Xavier’s College student Priyanka Singh said, “I had seen the last one on January 1, but wished to watch the phenomenon today. I can’t wait to see the photos and videos which will be released by the NASA. I believe seeing it with naked eyes will be a good omen. I missed this golden opportunity.”Another student, Krishnakant Sharma was also annoyed with the foggy weather conditions. “I came here with my friends at 5.30pm, but unfortunately we were not able to view the supermoon. My friends from Kolkata sent me the pictures of lunar eclipse,” he said.“Through the presentation at the science centre, I have learned a lot about supermoon, blood moon and lunar eclipse. These things really fascinate me. I wish I could witness this,” said Rohit Kumar, a Class IX student of Scholars Abode.SKSC’s education officer Satish Ranjan said the lunar eclipse was special because supermoon (appears larger than usual in its perigee), blue moon (second full moon of the month) and blood moon (appears red during eclipse) coincided at once. During the eclipse, the moon slowly loses its brightness and takes on a reddish hue because of the way the atmosphere bends the light. As the second full moon of the month, it earned the title of a blue moon as well,” he said.

       " 'PATNA: Skies over Patna turned cloudy in the early evening hours on Wednesday and weather forecasting agencies predicted that the intensity of fog would increase over the Indo-Gangetic plains, including Bihar for a few days from Thursday.While the cloud cover was attributed to a cyclonic circulation over east Bihar and adjoining sub-Himalayan West Bengal, the expected increase in intensity of fog was attributed to western disturbance.An all-India weather bulletin issued by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Wednesday afternoon stated that scattered to fairly widespread rainfall was likely to occur over Jammu and Kashmir in the next 48 hours under the influence of a western disturbance. The rainfall in the Upper Himalayan region is, in turn, expected to lead to increase in the intensity of fog over the Indo-Gangetic plains from Thursday.Private weather agency Skymet too predicted that dense fog was expected to grip parts of north-east Uttar Pradesh and the northern parts of Bihar over the next three-four days. This condition may occur due to the passage of a persisting western disturbance and another one is likely to affect the western Himalayan region and adjoining plains from February 2 onwards.Western disturbances are low-pressure areas or extra tropical storms, originating from the Mediterranean Sea, Red Sea and Caspian Sea, which cause winter snow or rainfall in the northwestern Indian subcontinent.Weather conditions, especially in terms of fog, had significantly improved in the region in the past week. Cold wave as well as cold day conditions had also subsided. The minimum temperature in Patna on Tuesday was recorded at 10.5 degrees C, which was equal to the respective normal.The fog is, however, expected to make a comeback from February 3 owing to reduction in cold north-westerly winds blowing at an average speed of 15-20kmph over the Indo-Gangetic plains. The revival of foggy weather is expected to lead to a drop in temperature, but the possibility of cold day conditions has been ruled out.',\n",
       " 'PATNA: The Patna high court on Wednesday ruled that the fundamental rights of a citizen could not be taken away by the officials by arbitrary use of prohibition law.The division bench of Chief Justice Rajendra Menon and Justice Anil Kumar Upadhyay was hearing a PIL filed by Nagrik Adhikar Manch against the government’s order for cutting all palm trees and digging land at Khajurbani in Gopalganj district after the hooch tragedy which had claimed 18 lives on August 16, 2016. The officials had also ordered collective fine on the villagers and confiscation of some houses.“Why are you taking away the citizens’ fundamental rights of farming and other things. In the garb of prohibition law, officials are acting mechanically without applying brain. You can’t just raze every house in the village to search liquor,” Chief Justice Menon remarked while expressing unhappiness over the way officials were acting in cases related to prohibition.Justice Upadhyay asked the state to reply first what action was taken against the government officials and the accused responsible for the incident. The court later ordered Saran divisional commissioner to submit an action taken report (ATR) within four weeks’ time about every step taken by the state government after the hooch tragedy. Dinu Kumar and Ritika Rani represented the petitioner.The court also cited the example of seizure of a North Bengal State Transport Corporation (NBSTC) bus at Zero Mile in Begusarai just because liquor bottles were recovered from the luggage of a passenger travelling in it.The writ filed by NBSTC was also heard by the same court which ordered the Begusarai district magistrate to release the bus within a week. According to NBSTC’s counsel Manoj Kumar, the bus was seized on July 15 last year and its driver along with four other persons was arrested and sent to jail.On January 24, the court had served show-cause notice to state chief secretary as why such actions under prohibition law were being taken which were not only creating difficulties for the citizens at large but also multiplying the litigations in the court.Since the chief secretary could not submit his reply on Wednesday, the court granted him additional two weeks’ time. The police officials who had seized the bus were present in the court.The bench cited another incident when a banker was transporting his household goods from Noida to West Bengal after getting transferred. The vehicle with all household goods was seized because there was liquor bottle in it while passing through Bihar. The banker, along with the vehicle owner and driver, was also booked under the prohibition law.The Chief Justice observed that such mechanical action taken by officials did not show any application of mind and analysis of facts in proper manner, causing sufferings not only to the people of Bihar but from other states as well.Govt reply sought on dumping carcasses on roadside, in rivers:The Patna high court on Wednesday ordered the state government and the Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC) to reply within three weeks’ time why had they failed to comply with its order of not dumping carcasses in rivers or on roadside.The division bench of Chief Justice Rajendra Menon and Justice Anil Kumar Upadhyay was hearing a contempt petition filed by social activist Vikash Chandra alias Guddu Baba. In 2010, he had urged the court to order the officials concerned for proper disposal of carcasses.The then Chief Justice Dipak Misra, now the Chief Justice of India, had ordered that no carcasses would be thrown into the Ganga or on its banks and even on roadside. He had also ordered for proper disposal of the carcasses and had fixed responsibility on sanitary inspectors of PMC to display their contact numbers at every nook and corner so that people could contact them for disposing carcasses.The petitioner, on Wednesday, submitted several pictures of carcasses dumped at multiple locations in Patna, which was a clear violation of the HC order.The petitioner told TOI that Rs3.97 crore was coughed up by the PMC for setting up an incinerator at Bairiya Ramchak in Patna for carcass disposal. “The incinerator started functioning on March 16 last year, but most of the time it remains out of order,” he said.',\n",

It will continue so long as atrocities on these sections continue to be practised,” Modi said, adding: “For the next 100 years, the quota facility provided for them is unlikely to be reversed. Those who oppose it should explain why have social inequality and atrocities on them have continued to be practised.”Modi was addressing a function organized by the SC, ST forum of the BJP to celebrate the birth anniversary of Sant Raidas (or Ravidas). Union minister for social justice and empowerment Thawar Chand Gehlot inaugurated the function and described the policies implemented by the Narendra Modi government for the welfare of the SC and ST sections.Modi said both the Centre and the state government would separately move the Supreme Court for the review of the order that had earlier abolished the reservation in promotion to higher posts facilitated for the SCs and STs.Modi said the state government would open 13 new residential schools for SC and ST children and upgrade the existing 48 residential middle schools to high schools. The official work in this regard has already started, he said.Modi said the problem with SCs and STs is that these people remain uninformed about the laws and provisions meant for their welfare and uplift. The law has provided that an SC/ST person would get Rs8.25 lakh in case of death in accident, a dalit girl/woman would similarly get Rs5 lakh in case of rape and a couple would get Rs2.5 lakh for intercaste marriage. “But potential beneficiaries remain deprived of the benefits because they don’t have information about these provisions,” Modi said.',\n",
       " 'NEW DELHI: The Centre will modify provisions of the Delhi Master Plan to provide relief to traders hit by the sealing drive with changes, including uniform floor area ratio for shopcum-residence plots, permitting commercial activities in basements and reducing fines.The uniform FAR will also apply to complexes operating on commercial streets and proposals will be put to the DDA board on Friday for approval. The housing and urban affairs ministry on Wednesday also reduced the period for public scrutiny of changes in the master plan to three days from 45.Video Player is loading.The reduced window for public comments is intended to ensure changes approved by the DDA Board become norms within days of adoption and are seen as emergency measures, as the city braces for a “mini election” in the event of the disqualification of 20 AAP MLAs being upheld by the Delhi high court. The political context and the deepening agitation among traders over the court-mandated sealings has injected a note of urgency in the Centre’s actions.Housing and urban affairs minister Hardeep Singh Puri said the Centre has acted to preserve public order and address widespread concerns. “Even if we get the whole thing passed by the authority (DDA), 45 days for public hearing will not only (deepen) uncertainty but also create chaos. This will also become an issue of public order,” Puri said.“We will file an affidavit before the Supreme Court prior to the next date of hearing on January 7. The court has asked for an affidavit,” Puri said. The minister said these are credible solutions and there is a need to bring clarity on issue from pre-1962 (before first Master Plan) and the post-1962 regimes.Sources said the decision to reduce the public notice period will also help government to notify more streets — the municipal corporations have listed more than 350 — as commercial or mixed land use areas. The Delhi government will have to list these streets with the Centre. There are also indications that the relief provided could be one-time.TOI on Monday had first reported that the Centre will come out with solutions before February 2, the date announced by traders for a 48-hour protest. It was also reported that the DDA technical committee had decided to increase the FAR from 180 to 300 in shopping-cum-residential areas and other measures.Puri did not specify whether there will also be uniform conversion charges. He said penalty charges for non-registration and non-payment of shop-cum-residences will be reduced from present 10 fold. As per the master plan, commercial establishments on notified commercial roads have to pay conversion and parking charges as per rates fixed by DDA.As of now, properties found to be under commercial use without registration, have not paid conversion charges or violate terms and conditions need to pay 10 times the annual conversion charge as penalty.Sources said traders bodies have requested the penalty be reduced to two times the annual conversion charges. Puri also said DDA will frame a policy for regularising godown clusters in non-conforming areas and agriculture areas, which are now being sealed.',\n",
       " 'Amaravati: The fate of the prestigious Amaravati-Anantapur national expressway is hanging in balance as the Centre has backtracked from its promise of fully funding the project, including the land acquisition cost. The proposed expressway is a dream project of chief minister Chandrababu Naidu to provide easy connectivity to the Rayalaseema region with the capital city.In fact, it is considered to be the first and only national highway designed as straight lane highway in the country. The entire highway covers a distance of nearly 371km without any curves.Union ministry of road transport and highways, which initially agreed to grant 100% funding to the project as one-time gift to Andhra Pradesh, has recently communicated it will take up the project only if the state provides land.The state government is in a piquant situation on going for land acquisition as it will require nearly Rs 2,500crore-Rs 4,000 crore to complete the process.Besides, opposition from the farmers to part with the land is also expected to derail the plan. Already, farmers associations in Guntur, Prakasam, Kadapa and Kurnool have started agitations opposing the land acquisition.“We do not need a straight-lane highway at the cost of farmers losing massive extent of lands,” said former minister and farmers leader Vadde Sobhanadreswara Rao. “No highway in the world has been designed in a straight lane. This project has been conceived to benefit the contractors.”To avoid the delay in land acquisition, the state government is also mulling land pooling schemes (LPS), similar to the ones implemented in the capital city area. The government will have to acquire over 27,000 acres, including 1,517 acres of forest land in four districts. In Guntur district alone, it needs to take over about 7,000 acres from the farmers.Field level surveys and peg marking of the land required for expressway have been recently completed, and district administrations are awaiting the final go-ahead from the state government.The Andhra Pradesh government has readied a detailed project report (DPR) and submitted it to the Centre for immediate launch of works.As per the DPR, the expressway has been designed for a speed of 120-140 kmph with straight alignments, avoiding habitations and other obstructions. Tunnels and viaducts have also been included in the design to negotiate hilly terrains and valley sections.',\n",
       " 'Vijayawada: Amendments to the Non-Agriculture Assessment Act (NALA Act), is set to give a boost not only to the real estate business but also to the industrial sector in the capital city and also across the state, according to experts.The state government has made the much-needed changes by reducing land conversion charges to give a thrust to new industries and the real estate sector. NALA conversion charges have been reduced to 2 per cent from 5 per cent in Vijayawada and Visakhapatnam cities. The charges at other places have come down from 9 per cent to 3 per cent.The reduction in land conversion charges would be transferred to land rates. Land prices are likely to come down by 1,000 per square yard in Vijayawada and Visakhapatnam where average prices are hovering over 40,000 per square yard. The land prices in other areas are also likely to come down by at least 500 per square yard once the new charges come into effect.President of the Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Association of India (CREDAI), Andhra Pradesh chapter, YV Ramana Rao said that industrialists are facing a major problem in the form of exorbitant land prices in Andhra Pradesh. Once the amended NALA comes into force, investment on land will increase.Another important aspect that was brought in the form of amendment is that land conversion can be done online. Anyone can pay respective fee at any Mee Seva Centre and the land conversion would be done online within 15 days’ time. This would bring speed in the process as many of the projects are taking longer periods to take off as the land conversion is taking too much time.Andhra Pradesh Real Estate Developers’ Association (APREDA) general secretary, Gadde Tirupati Rao, said that it is taking nearly six months for land conversion to be completed. Now, with the new rules taking effect, the process would be completed within 15 days, he said.Apart from reducing the delays the system, it would also curb corruption. As the conversion is being done online without having to approach any office, the scope for corruption has almost come down.However, the industry experts express concern over the new amendments. They opine that if it is not made foolproof, the automatic system may be misused by mischievous elements. Though land conversion has nothing to do with ownership of land, people who claim ownership over disputed lands through fake or forged documents, are likely to take advantage of the system to cheat people, Yalavarti Srikanth, a builder from Vijayawada, said.He said the rules should be framed in such a way that there should not be any scope for the miscreants to misuse the system.',\n",

       " 'Nagpur: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has directed all its 112 corporators at Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) to submit their resignation letters to the party. Wary of a revolt by some corporators over selection of chairman and members of standing committee, the saffron party has come up with the unusual missive.Following directives of BJP city president Sudhakar Kohle, ruling party leader Sandip Joshi has asked 112 corporators — 108 elected and four co-opted — to submit their resignation letters before the general body meeting on February 3. BJP sources told TOI over 60% corporators have already submitted their resignation letters.The BJP will have to select one of its 108 elected corporators for the post of standing committee chairman, and 11 as members for 2018-19 fiscal. Announcement of candidate for post of chairman is likely early next month.Joshi told TOI it was a regular exercise in the BJP. “Party used to take resignation letters from corporators immediately after municipal elections. This time, the party forgot to take resignation letters in February last year. Therefore, corporators have been asked to submit it now. I was the first to submit resignation letter to Kohle,” he said.Some senior BJP corporators told TOI on condition of anonymity it was an old tradition in the party but abandoned since 2012 municipal elections. “We were not asked for such letters after getting elected in February last year. Why suddenly party leaders needed resignation letters,” they questioned.NMC sources told TOI some senior BJP corporators demanded standing committee chairman post to couple of senior corporators from South Nagpur. “Also, these senior corporators have warned of revolt against the party if their demand is not fulfilled. Already, BJP got some setback with Nana Patole’s resignation from Bhandara-Gondia Lok Sabha constituency. Katol MLA Ashish Deshmukh too has started to raise voices against the party. Some corporators are not happy with Kohle. Therefore, BJP does not want to take any risk, that too with only a year for Lok Sabha elections. BJP leaders think corporators will not revolt in case their resignation letters are collected in advance,” sources said.BJP has prepared a format of the resignation letters. Staffers from BJP office are calling corporators to inform them about the decision, and also sending them the form on their mobiles using social media. Corporators are asked to fill in the details on their letter heads and submit it with their signature.The BJP’s missive has created unrest among corporators. Kohle said a meeting will be held with corporators to clarify any confusion in their minds in coming days.Many BJP corporators said on condition of anonymity they were upset with the party’s move. Senior BJP corporator Jagdish Gwalbanshi said it was very unfortunate to learn about the party’s decision. “I did not receive any call but came to know about this from other corporators. I will follow whatever my party wants me to do. But this indicates my party leaders do not have faith in me, so they are taking resignation letters. Party has all the right to take action in case of revolt or anti-party activities by any corporator. Therefore, there is no need to take resignation letters from corporators,” he said.The BJP has not taken any such resignation letters from its legislators. “Party should have ensured this immediately after municipal elections. This missive will upset corporators as it comes after one year of election. Party leaders should have avoided it at this time,” said a BJP legislator.',\n",
       " \"MUMBAI: India scored slightly better than the global average when it comes to budget transparency, according to results of the Open Budget Survey (2017) released on January 30.With a rank of 53 among 115 countries covered by the survey, India’s score of 48 out of 100 for transparency (as against the global average of 43), showed an improvement of 2 percentage points over the 2015 index.Every two years, the International Budget Partnership (IBP), using over a hundred indicators, assesses budget transparency based on the amount, level of detail and timeliness of budget information made available to the public.Results of the Open Budget Survey (2017), highlight that the global average score of budget transparency has declined by 2 percentage points from 45 in 2015 to 43 in 2017. It reflects that 89 out of the 115 countries fail to make sufficient budget information publicly available. IBP states that this failure undermines the ability of citizens to hold their government to account for managing public funds.Countries like New Zealand and South Africa (with scores of 89 each) topped the charts whereas Saudi Arabia scored one or for that matter Qatar and Yemen scored a zero indicating that no budget information being available in the public domain. The average score for South Asian countries (Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka) was 46, an increase of 5 percentage points over the 2015 survey results.To improve budget transparency, IBP suggests that India should draft and publish a pre-budget statement and mid-year review. Pre budget statements are published by nearly 50 countries, including India’s neighbour – Afghanistan. It should also increase the information in the budget proposals by providing detailed information on the financial position of the government and extra-budgetary funds. India should also provide more information, such as comparisons between planned revenue and actual outcomes and a comparison between the original macroeconomic forecast and actual outcomes.In terms of public participation, the Open Budget Survey (2017) gave India a score of 15 out of 100, denoting that few opportunities are provided to the public to engage in the budget process. Interestingly, this score is above the global average of 12. For improving public participation, IBP suggests introduction of a pilot mechanism (such as social audits) to enable the public and government officials to exchange views on national budget mattes during monitoring of the national budget implementation.Among India’s neighbours, Nepal had the highest score of 24 on the public participation parameter. India tied with Afghanistan with a score of 15. Bangladesh followed with a score of 13.In terms of budget oversight, India obtained a score of 48. The IBP said that the legislature and supreme audit institution (which is the Comptroller and Auditor General – CAG) provide weak oversight during the planning stage of the budget cycle and limited oversight during the implementation stage of the budget cycle.For the 2017 survey, documents that should have been published prior to December 2016, were assessed. According to India based think-tank, the Centre for Budget and Governance Accountability which partnered with IBP: “In terms of publishing timely and relevant information in the audit reports and year end reports, India has scored well above other countries. Non publication of a pre-budget statement and mid-year review in 2016 lowered India’s score. However, had the survey been carried out for financial year 2017-18, India’s score would have been higher, advancing the presentation of the budget by a month since last year has made the earlier practice of Vote on Account redundant and the full budget gets enacted before the start of the new financial year.”WATCHWill Arun Jaitley's Budget 2018 be Populist Budget?\",\n",

The AAP government is also hoping that the Centre would allocate funds to boost its plans to introduce electric buses to promote ashift to clean energy.It has been learnt from reliable sources that in the annual pre-Budget meeting at the ministry of finance, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia made aspecial reference to the state’s intention to introduce electric buses. For that the government is learnt to have sought for Rs 2,000 crore.With air pollution posing an existential threat to Delhi, the government circles have been increasingly talking about shifting to greener public transport. TOI had reported earlier that chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had made his keenness for a city-wide plan for zero-emission vehicles known to officials. Last year too, Sisodia had reiterated the demand for an increase in the share in central taxes.This year also, the government sees public transport and pollution as the key challenges. Electric mobility across buses, private cars, taxis, three and two-wheelers would be focused on. But sources in the CM’s office cautiously pointed out that electric mobility could not be a quick fix for pollution, though it’s part of the long-term plan. The government has been proposing to add electric buses to its public transport fleet this year. This is in sync with its attempts to promote clean energy.According to sources, the biggest challenge in making electric mobility a reality is understanding the capital costs involved. Another test would be to set up facilities to charge these vehicles. “When you think of scaling up the idea beyond buses to vehicles on the streets like taxis, threewheelers, two-wheelers and even private cars, the scope is huge and will require a detailed policy for execution,” a source said.There are plans to make way for standard-size electric buses to run on the longer routes and midi and mini-sized ones to provide last-mile connectivity between Delhi Metro stations and residential areas within a 5-km radius.',\n",

Also, the complainant said the DTCP issued occupation certificate (OC) to these villas, ignoring the violation of building norms.The OC — TOI has a copy— issued by the DTCP in 2007 does not mention swimming pools in these villas.The certificate was granted by the town planner on the condition that it would stand automatically cancelled if any changes were made in the building. The certificate is also liable to be cancelled if one builds additional floors or makes alterations in the building without the competent authority’s approvalRajendra Goel, a resident of Sushant Lok-III, who filed the complaint on the CM Window, claimed that during the launch of villas, the developer had given advertisements in newspapers showing swimming pools. “Through a right to information (RTI) plea, we got to know that there was no swimming pool in the building plans of these villas,” Goel said, adding that more than 300 villas, in which the developer had illegally constructed swimming pools, were sold for premium prices.He alleged that villas had not been constructed as per the approved plan. “Still, the developer sold these villas.

He often caught hold of her, grabbed her hand or groped her when she objected.“I was shocked to hear that this 32-year-old man was harassing my daughter for so many days. I have seen Kumar inside the village and know that he stays nearby. He is a drunkard. I wasted no time after my daughter told me about it and immediately approached the cops to file a complaint. A strict action should be taken against him so that he does not dare to repeat such shameful act in the future,” the girl’s father said.Following the complaint, an FIR was registered against Kumar under Section 12 (sexual harassment) of the POCSO Act and Section 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC at Bhondsi police station.Kumar was arrested on Wednesday and produced in a city court that sent him to judicial custody.“The accused, who is a liquor addict, has confessed to his crime and said that he harassed the girl under the influence of alcohol,” said inspector Umesh Kumar, SHO, Bhondsi police station.',\n",
       " 'GURUGRAM: The outcome of the first Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) board meeting on Wednesday didn’t quite match up to the landmark occasion. The announcement that stood out was actually a deferment of the city’s most awaited transport project. The city bus service will not roll out this summer and is likely to be launched neared autumn instead. Chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar announced a new date: August 15.Expectations from the first GMDA meeting were high, mainly around the bus service and metro projects for Gurugram, which is battling a chronic congestion problem because of its heavy dependence on cars. But there was nothing on metro’s proposed extensions from Huda City Centre to the railway station, and further to Dwarka.Those hoping the first GMDA meeting would provide a final shape to the establishment of a medical college and a multispecialty hospital in Sector 67 were also left disappointed as the CM, who chaired the meeting, made no mention of these.And if the bus service does roll out in August, it will be without air-conditioned buses. “The city bus service is likely to be operational by August 15 this year. Initially, there will be around 200 buses that will be rolled out. These will be non-AC buses,” Khattar said.Officials said all four bus manufacturers in the country had expressed their inability to provide low-floor buses before August and sought a year’s time for low-floor AC buses, which would mean the first lot of air-conditioned carriages will hit the road only in 2019.Asked about the metro projects, GMDA CEO V Umashankar said, “We felt since the metro is not directly under GMDA but is under HMRTC (Haryana Mass Rapid Transport Corporation), it would be the agency that will finalise the route.”Gurugram MP Rao Inderjit Singh, who also attended the meeting, said the Khattar government should connect the Rapid Metro network with the proposed metro route to the railway station. “Rapid Metro is running into losses and there is a need to connect it with the new metro route that is being planned, otherwise it will shut shop. The authorities need to plan it in such a way that the line coming from Dwarka or Gurugram railway station is be connected to Rapid Metro so that it becomes viable,” he said.He also sharply criticized the government for failing to provide even a single multi-level parking in the city. “For the past 10 years, I have been hearing that multi-level parking will be developed but there has been no forward movement. There has been no development as far as healthcare and transport is concerned.”The Residents Advisory Council (RAC), which is to advise and provide guidance to the GMDA, is yet to be formed. Nine more standing committees are yet to take shape as well. The chief minister said these committees will be formed soon.',\n",

They also accused ditrict town planner (DTP) of not pulling up the realtor despite its failure. A total of 2,500 residents live in the township.Residents said without an OC, they cannot get legal sewer and canal water connections, as a result of which they are forced to draw water from the bore well with an annual extraction reaching around 22 crore litres. They also said they are unable to insure their properties too.Residents were given possession of flats in 2010, and were supposed to get the OC then. “But between 2010 to 2017, nearly 15 towers emerged in Fresco and possession of nearly all of them was given to the inmates,” said Nilesh Tandon, general secretary, Nirvana Fresco Society RWA. “Preparations are underway to give possession to the buyers of apartments in the 16th tower.”Residents said all apartments were registered with the government. “There is litany of limitations that have occurred because of this. We have raised the issue with authorities from time to time, but there has been no breakthrough. If something untoward happens, we won’t get damages,” Subash, another resident added.Residents also said while Unitech was giving all its commercial projects Occupation Certificates immediately, same to residential projects was unforthcoming.An DTPC official said Unitech’s licence had expired and it hadn’t renewed it for years. “Without license, they cannot seek OCs,” the official said. “Now they have paid some amount and DTPC has recommended head offices in Chandigarh to issue the OCs on special case-basis. The response is awaited from the Chandigarh offices.”',\n",

But in cases of illegal construction by some well-connected people, we are under immense pressure. We have sent them demolition notices, in some cases even twice. But we have been instructed not to act against them,” said an official requesting that he not be identified as he was not authorised to speak on the issue.The corporation has prepared a list of over a dozen illegal properties that it would have pulled had there been no alleged meddling. Many of these structures are on the Old Delhi-Gurugram road, the sources said. For instance, there are 11 illegal shops on the stretch near Ajit Cinema, according to officials. The corporation was also learnt to have prepared a list of illegal shops in the green belt of Surya Vihar and similar structures in the Gandhi Nagar Gali, Patel Nagar , near Jharsa Dam, Palam Vihar and Ashok Vihar.According to the sources, these structures should have been demolished within this month had the officials not received calls from politicians asking them not to proceed. Sources pointed out that it was ironical that the corporation’s enforcement team had been carrying out drives to lift commercial establishments and vendor carts from several areas of the city but “helpless” against builders with political connections.Encroachment has been cause for concern for officials around the city and the issue had reportedly been raised in the previous house meeting of the enforcement team of the DTP, which had listed the problems they faced while carrying out drives against illegal construction.One of the DTP enforcement officials had earlier said: “We don’t have resources to carry out such drives in the city. Despite multiple complaints in this regard, no action has been taken yet.”',\n",

Similarly, a 66-KV transmission tower is located on the unidirectional flyover located on the other side. After these two towers are removed, the flyovers will be opened by March 31, easing traffic movement for commuters on the stretch. Another unidirectional flyover at Iffco Chowk is already operational while a right-turn at the junction will be thrown open later.According to the NHAI officials, HVPNL is in charge of high-tension power cables and transmission towers on roads and highways. On January 15, NHAI had written to HVPNL, asking for a revised rate for the work of removing the towers which will be done by the NHAI consultant.According to NHAI consultant Bloom Companies, HVPN has now revised the rate for shifting of the transmission towers and has included the GST components and some additional quantities in it.Saurabh Singhal, traffic transportation expert at Bloom Companies, said, “We have accepted the revised rates given by HVPN. The 220 KV electrical wires have been placed in newly-built electrical ducts and we will soon begin the work of bringing down the wires in the presence of HVPN officials. In a matter of a month, all three Iffco Chowk flyovers will be operational.”After the HVPNL nod, Ashok Sharma, project director, NHAI, confirmed, “The Iffco Chowk flyover will be opened by March 31.” NHAI had submitted its plan, including removal of electrical towers and other utilities falling in the alignment of the Iffco Chowk project, to the Haryana government at least a year ago.HVPNL superintendent engineer Anil Yadav said, “The matter is now in the hands of NHAI.

A day after he was released on bail by Gurugram police, Amu sent his resignation to Haryana BJP chief Subhash Barala during his visit to Chittorgarh to pay tribute to Rani Padmini, whose legend inspired the film Padmaavat.Amu (51) sent his resignation around 5pm on Wednesday. He sent a text to Barala, saying, “I, Suraj Pal Amu, with a heavy heart, resign from my primary membership in the party. I hope you will accept it with immediate effect. Thanks, Yours, Suraj Pal Amu.” He had earlier resigned from the post of chief media coordinator of the state unit of BJP. The party had already initiated disciplinary action against Amu.Speaking to TOI, Amu said, “I am concerned the BJP does not value its party workers. I am a Rajput and cannot compromise on my self-respect in this manner.” He also thanked those who supported Karni Sena and other Rajput outfits in protests against Padmaavat. Police had put Amu under preventive detention on January 25 for inciting violent protests in Gurugram against the controversial film.“In jail, I met other young men who were detained for protesting against the film. I immediately decided that the first thing I will do after my release is pray at mother Padmini’s feet. I feel blessed now,” he said. On January 25, a mob seeking to protect the honour of the queen had attacked buses carrying schoolchildren in Gurugram. Speaking about his resignation, Amu hinted some BJP leaders felt threatened by him. He said, “My friends who are at high posts in BJP are worried about my stature, so I have relieved them of the burden. But they are still my friends.”BJP state spokesperson Raman Malik said, “It is his individual decision and the party president will look into it. I cannot comment on his assessment of party leaders but he should name those who allegedly plotted against him. Since he is always claiming that he is dedicated to the RSS and BJP, he would be doing a good service by naming those people, so that no other karyakarta suffers like him.”',\n",
       " 'NEW DELHI: Acting on the Law Commission’s recommendations, the Centre is planning to bring stricter rules under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act to stop cruel practices against egg-laying hens (layers) and broiler chickens.The move is also aimed at addressing global concerns over unhygienic conditions of poultry farms in India which has been exporting poultry products to many countries.Pointing out that eating chicken and eggs of a poultry where the chickens are kept in a cage is harmful to human health, the Commission had, in its report to the law ministry last year, highlighted the need to maintain cleanliness and hygiene in poultry farms.It had also recommended certification of poultry farms by the animal husbandry departments of the states and suggested bringing rules for broiler chicken and egg-laying hens to this effect. The regulation is expected to be in place where a distinction is drawn between produce obtained from cage-free egg farming and the one obtained from battery-cage (confinement) farming.Besides the law panel, the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) too had looked into the issue and suggested stricter rules. It had even come out with draft rules.The Commission referred to various representations while pressing for new rules. It said, “The representations brought to the Commission’s notice the unhygienic conditions of the poultry industry and the effect of battery-cage confinement on the well-being of the birds.” It also referred to the increase of fatal diseases like cancer due to unhygienic conditions the birds are kept in.“Bringing regulations for producing these products in a hygienic manner will also help in increasing export volume,” said an official, adding that poultry is one of the fastest growing segments of the agricultural sector in India.Production of eggs and broilers has been rising at a rate of 8 to 10%. As a result, India is now the world’s fifth largest egg producer and the 18th largest producer of broilers.According to Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA), poultry meat is the fastest growing component of global meat demand, and India is experiencing rapid growth in its poultry sector.The country had exported 4,49,527 metric tonnes of poultry products worth Rs 531.65 crore during 2016-17. Oman, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Russia and Maldives were major export destinations of Indian poultry products during the year.',\n",

After months of discussions, the transaction had progressed into documentation work with Manipal only awaiting the outcome of the court order, sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.Similarly, the two troubled siblings have been in protracted discussions to sell parts of their financial services business under Religare Enterprises.The latest HC order would prompt Daiichi to seek custody of promoter shares in Fortis, though a substantial part of it is pledged with banks. This could lead to banks taking proactive steps to protect their interests. “Now there’s a situation where Manipal wouldn’t know who will control the shares. Hopefully there will be some clarity in the next two weeks,” sources added.A merger rather than a sale of the promoter shares was contemplated to abide by earlier court order asking the Religare founders not to alienate or sell any of their assets. Fortis has sought extended deadlines with market regulator Sebi to declare its second quarter results amid swirling rumours of financial difficulties.A favorable order for the Singhs would have seen more suitors showing up for their assets, including Fortis, which is one of the largest private hospital networks in the country.',\n",
       " 'Nagpur: The CBSE’s latest decision to scrap its uniform assessment system for Std VI-VIII seems to be the result of strong objections from the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR). Without citing any reason, the board had on January 22 issued a three-line circular declaring that uniform assessment plan has been ‘repealed’ for Std VI-VIII (the scheme continues for Std IX).While CBSE was silent on the details, Priyank Kanoongo, member of NCPRC (RTE & Education), said the NCPCR believed the central board had exceeded its brief. “CBSE was indulging in what we defined as ‘academic discrimination’. Academic matters related to students till Std VIII have to be handled as per the National Curriculum Framework and the nodal authority for it is National Council for Educational Research and Training (NCERT). When you deviate from the laid down policies, the results are that books of private publishers land up in bags of children, which not only adds to the cost for parents but also to the weight the child has to carry each day on his back.”So, if CBSE did step on NCERT’s toes, why did Kanoongo object? “NCPCR is the monitoring agency for RTE in the country. You are noticing it because we are taking a stand now, for the benefit of children. In fact, such a stand should have been taken long ago, saving children a lot of trouble,” said Kanoongo.Regardless of him taking a tough stand on the issue, Kanoongo says he appreciates CBSE’s gesture. “We welcome this decision of CBSE, as it is in the best interest of the children of our country. CBSE’s role in nation’s education system is very important and we appreciate its good practices,” said Kanoongo.He added that every organization must stick to its mandate for smooth functioning of the system. “Everything is defined under the law, guidelines, policies. CBSE’s job is to conduct the board exam for affiliated schools. Period. If there is an issue related to curriculum, the NCERT will take care of it. We are there to ensure the rights of the child are not compromised,” said Kanoongo.TOI sought an official statement from CBSE regarding this development. Till the time of going to press, no reply had been received.Schools too are eagerly awaiting further clarification from CBSE. A principal said, “The circular just says that something has been cancelled for Std VI-VIII. Fine, but what now? Are we supposed to go back to CCE system, where just half portion was taught at one time, or should it be the traditional board system where entire course is taught?”Some senior academicians associated with CBSE for over two decades say the latest circular literally means ‘do it yourself’. A senior principal said, “It’s open to interpretation, but I am convinced it does not mean going back to CCE system, because that does not exist in Std X anymore. So, whatever pattern a school decides has to be consistent with what students will ultimately follow for board exam.”Considering this decision has come very late in the academic session, the confusion is compounded. “We have been trying to get answers from the Chennai regional office but nothing has come out of it so far. I have heard that CBSE will issue a circular to clarify things,” said another principal.',\n",

He pointed out that the developments as claimed by the corporation were of 1996-97, and old records needed to be traced out for confirming whether Dr Hedgewar Smarak Samiti premises was actually granted a status of ‘place of pilgrimage’ by the government.“Submission is that about 20-21 years back, the place in dispute has been declared as place of reverence (Shraddhasthan) and file in that respect is being traced out,” the judges noted.The court was hearing a PIL by social activist Janardhan Moon through counsel Ashwin Ingole contending that though RSS is an unregistered organization, still the civic body is extending undue favours to them at taxpayers’ expense. In a series of reports, TOI exposed that though the rules make an exception for notified tourist sites or pilgrim places like Deekshabhoomi, the RSS headquarters is neither of these.Citing media reports, the petitioner pointed out that the proposal to build a compound wall and internal roads was first moved by ruling party leader Sandip Joshi and former mayor Pravin Datke in NMC. The Standing Panel under Jadhav later cleared it on September 12 with a majority of votes, even as Congress corporators opposed the move. Leader of opposition Tanaji Wanwe too demanded an immediate withdrawal of the order while citing NMC’s financial ill-health. Manoj Sangole, Harish Gwalbansi and Ansari Sayeeda Begum of Congress and Jitendra Ghodeshwar of BSP registered their protest during the meeting.Moon argued that the BJP-ruled corporation always cite reason of financial crunch when it comes to mandatory works like road, potholes and gutter line repairs. The rains have badly exposed its tall claims of good roads with majority of them are riddled with potholes. Even schools run by the civic body are in pathetic conditions, but its officials didn’t have funds to improve their condition. It doesn’t have the funds to build storm water network on roads which often led to rainwater gushing down nearby homes.',\n",

Malvinder and Shivinder Singh have been in advanced talks to merge FortisDaiichi had entered into a settlement agreement with the US department of justice, agreeing to pay $500 million penalty to resolve potential, civil and criminal liability. The claims relate to the sale of Ranbaxy shares by the Singh brothers to Daiichi in 2008 for Rs 9,576 crore. Sun Pharmaceuticals later acquired the company from Daiichi.On Wednesday, Justice Jayant Nath held that the 2016 award can be enforced against the Singh brothers.“The Supreme Court has clearly held that enforcement of a foreign award would be refused only if such enforcement would be contrary to the fundamental policy of Indian Law. While considering enforceability of foreign awards, the court does not exercise appellate jurisdiction over the foreign award nor does it enquire as to whether while rendering the foreign award some errors have been committed,” HC noted in its verdict.Paving the way for enforcement of the arbitral award, HC noted it was “clearly within the domain of the Arbitral Tribunal to assess damages. The award has given various reasons for having rejected the suggested formula/computation by the respondent.”Justice Nath, however, set aside the liability pinned by the award against five minors, including Singh’s children on the ground that as per Indian law an award is not enforceable against minors. These children were also shareholders in Ranbaxy but HC said law is clear that they can’t be held liable of having perpetuated a fraud either themselves or through any agent.The court said the award against the minors was \"shockingly disproportionate\" as they were acting through their natural guardians, the Singh brothers, and had received a total sale consideration of only Rs 14 lakh.“Today’s judgment by the Hon’ble Delhi High Court has given partial success to some of the sellers of shares of erstwhile Ranbaxy (Respondents). The Court has held the award to be unenforceable against the Minors. However we are disappointed with the ruling against the rest of the sellers. After studying the order in detail the respondents will decide on further course of action,” RHC Holdings, a company controlled by the Singh brothers, said in a statement.Regarding the award amount, the court said it was clearly within the domain of the arbitral tribunal to assess damages. \"It is not possible to come to a conclusion that the computation done by the arbitral tribunal is in complete breach of statutory provisions or is contrary to fundamental policy of Indian Law inasmuch as the said computation suffers from patent illegality, going to the root of the matter,\" the court said.Daiichi had approached the high court in 2016 to seek the enforcement of a Rs 2,562 crore Singapore arbitral award passed in April 2016, along with an additional claim of interest and lawyers\\' fees incurred in connection with the proceedings.The tribunal\\'s award had come after the Japanese company invoked arbitration clause against Singhs alleging that they concealed important information while selling Ranbaxy in 2008.',\n",

There are various reasons for Kohale’s ouster.Former Nagpur South MLA Mohan Mate is the front-runner for his replacement. State BJP president Raosaheb Danve however, denied that there was any move to replace Kohale.Kohale had become the city president in January 2016 replacing Nagpur East MLA Krishna Khopade. Kohale belongs to Kunbi community while Khopade is a Teli. Mate is also a Kunbi and enjoys confidence of both Fadnavis and Gadkari.A source close to Fadnavis said that police cases of landgrabbing were going on against Kohale, which went against him. “Even though BJP did exceptionally well in Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) elections in 2017, he is not perceived to be instrumental in it. His performance as city president is not considered to be satisfactory,” the source added.“In addition, many BJP leaders have major problems with Kohale and they have become inactive in his tenure. With general elections scheduled next year, this is not a good sign. Kohale’s performance as an MLA is also considered to be satisfactory and he may not get the ticket next time. Mate might be his replacement,” the source further said.The source feels that Kohale should not bear a grudge towards the party if he is replaced. “He was a given a lot of important posts by the party in a very short time. He was given corporator’s ticket twice and was a trustee of Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT) for five years. He was then given MLA ticket in October 2014 and then made the city president in January 2016. He progressed a lot in a short duration,” he said.Another source close to the CM said that many more senior office-bearers of city BJP would be replaced in the coming months. “We need leaders whom grassroot workers trust and respect. They should be performers and the idlers would get the boot,” he added.Meanwhile, there are indications that Nagpur West MLA Sudhakar Deshmukh may not get the ticket in 2019. “NIT trustee Bhushan Shingne may get a chance,” a BJP source said.',\n",

He was fired upon twice on head from close range.Sources said the assailants had fired four shots. Two shots were fired in air to disperse the crowd while two to kill Usendi.A three-member action team of the banned outfit of the CPI (Maoist) killed Usendi, who was one of the accused in the case of arson at the site of Surjagarh mining project of Llyods Mining and Energy Limited when 80 vehicles were torched by the rebels on December 30, 2016. Sources in Gadchiroli said the rebels had strewn pamphlets over the body in which they had labelled him as 'police informer'. Police, however, refuted the claim.Usendi, along with another person identified as Raja Rajasthani, worked as labour contractors at the mining site. He was initially quizzed by the cops for his role in the arson but was not arrested. It was in February in 2017 that Usendi was nabbed carrying cash Rs4 lakh in a vehicle during a joint checking of police and revenue department prior to the elections. After Usendi failed to explain the source of the cash, he was booked for being a conduit between the mining company representatives and the Maoists. He was later released on bail.Usendi had been under scanner of the security forces as a covert Maoist sympathizer as he had a habit of flaunting his connections to the top rebel leader. It was also learnt that Reds too suspected that Usendi may have pocketed substantial amount from the mining company and others in their name. It was learnt that some people had warned Usendi to avoid weekly markets. Earlier, security forces used to be vigilant at these markets. However, the practice was later stopped after a police jawan died in a blast at one such market at Kotgul in north Gadchiroli last year.Addl SP, Gadchiroli, Maheshwar Reddy said, “We are probing the case and jawans from Burgi outpost have already been dispatched after receiving an input regarding Maoists.”\",\n",

Several objections have been received against hawking slots in posh localities of south Mumbai, Bandra’s Pali Hill and Powai.Activists alleged that the exercise was poorly handled and demanded that the BMC reach out to more people for feedback.

BMC officials said they will examine the details and take a decision within by next week. “To ensure that the hawkers’ list prepared by officials some years ago is not manipulated, we have instructed licence inspectors to re-examine the 99,435 eligible hawkers afresh match them with their Aadhaar card,” said an official.Viren Shah of the Federation of Retail Traders Welfare Association said, “The BMC proposed hawking pitches randomly, even outside temples, schools and stations. It shows that they were not serious while conducting the survey. They should withdraw the list. There was no awareness programme conducted by the BMC to explain the process to send feedback. Many people were unaware about the process due to which they were unable to send their complaints.”Civic officials said that they were concentrating on finalizing the hawkers’ list and invited public feedback after putting the list online. Officials refused to comment on the demand to extend the deadline.“We got most of the feedback in the month of December. After that, we gave a month’s extension, but few wrote to the BMC in January,” said an official. Deputy municipal commissioner Nidhi Choudhary said, “After examining the collected feedback we will prepare out list and put it before town vending committee for their examination. They will make the final list which will than go to a special committee that will be constituted under the mayor, to take final decision on the proposed list.”Samjawadi Party leader in the BMC Rais Shaikh said, “The feedback received shows that the process was badly handled. People were unaware about the pitches list. The BMC should extend the deadline and reach out to people, explaining the hawking pitches and feedback process.”',\n",

       " 'Later this year, Cape Town in South Africa faces an unthinkable situation. Barring a climactic miracle, this prosperous, famously beautiful coastal city with over four million residents will become the first major urban entity in the world to run out of water. Just this week, the city administration warned of less than 90 days supply remaining in the reservoirs. Three years of severe drought, combined with continuing unchecked usage, has produced a stark and unavoidable deadline. On April 22, fearfully called ‘Day Zero’, municipal water supply will be turned off for everything, but the most essential services, such as hospitals.After that the plan is something out of dystopian science fiction — each individual will have to go to a water distribution centre for a daily ration of 25 litres, with the entire process overseen by armed guards.This is uncharted territory for Cape Town, and the effects of this dramatic event cannot be predicted. No one can anticipate what will happen after Day Zero, when 5,000 people start lining up every morning to collect water rations. Probably the city will empty out, as other parts of South Africa have sufficient water resources to support larger numbers of people.Other parts of the world have fared very badly as climate change continues to steeply raise temperatures and alter long-standing weather patterns. Just a few days ago, the veteran foreign correspondent Somini Sengupta wrote in the New York Times, “Nigeria. Syria. Somalia. And now Iran. In each country, in different ways, a water crisis has triggered some combination of civil unrest, mass migration, insurgency, or even civil war. In the era of climate change, their experiences hold lessons for a great many other countries.”That list begins with India, which uses (actually wastes) more groundwater each year than China and the United States combined, adding up to a full quarter of the global total. Since the Green Revolution, the country has relied heavily on its groundwater reserves, which feeds over 60% of irrigated agriculture and almost 90% of domestic water use. This has led to a steady decline in levels, sometimes at the rate of a metre per year. Nasa ranks the Indus basin aquifer which feeds much of North India the second most stressed in the world. By 2030, at least 60% of the country’s groundwater resources will be in a critical condition, placing agriculture at risk in several states.These are very high stakes, which is precisely why Karnataka shut itself down earlier this week in protest over the Mhadei water dispute with Goa. Unconvinced with pre-elections political chicanery and bluffing about “reasonable and justified” extrajudicial sharing, pro-Kannada groups enforced a statewide bandh that extended to bus services between the neighbouring states. Whether or not that action is justified, the sentiment is perfectly understandable. It is an expression of desperation. Large parts of the state experienced sustained drought for almost a decade, killing off agriculture and forcing large-scale migration. The situation improved in 2017 thanks to unexpected monsoon bounty, but now everyone in Karnataka knows just how important water can be.That essential lesson has somehow not filtered to Goa yet, despite ample red flags and warning signs. Before a late burst of showers, the last monsoon was running an extremely 25% deficit right into September last year. A few months earlier, in the height of summer, state officials registered water levels lower than 50% of capacity in four of the five major reservoirs that supply drinking water to most citizens. The situation mercifully resolved itself, as it has been a decent run of adequate rains for several years for India’s smallest state, but no one can expect that record to continue endlessly in this era of climate change and extreme weather events.As with the other severe problems menacing Goa, water resources are abysmally mismanaged in Goa. Instead of harvesting and conserving on a war footing, there is extraordinary profligacy and absurdly unsustainable practices. Much of the dubiously approved new construction in the state — the Kadamba plateau is a particularly egregious example — is built despite the absence of water resources. These allegedly premium property developments are served by tankers, which very often steal water from already depleted community resources. It might seem manageable today, and perhaps for a little while longer while the going is good,and the state’s many rivers still flow fast from the Ghats to the sea.(Writer is a photographer and widely published columnist.

       " 'MAPUSA: Judicial magistrate first class, Pernem, on Wednesday granted bail to Isidore Fernandes, 44, of Anjuna, who was arrested for allegedly molesting a US national at Morjim during the Republic Day weekend.Fernandes was granted bail on furnishing a surety of Rs 10,000 and on condition that he will report to the police station for five days to cooperate with the investigation. Anjuna police nabbed the accused on Tuesday evening after taking cognisance of a Facebook post that was uploaded by the woman in Mumbai on Monday evening, which went viral. Fernandes was handed over to Pernem police as the alleged incident took place in their jurisdiction.Fernandes was booked under Sections 354, 354 –A of the Indian Penal Code.The first information report (FIR) lodged by Pernem police, based on the woman’s Facebook post, states, “On January 27, at Morjim, the accused person demanded sexual favour thereby insulting and outraging her modesty.” Police sub-inspector (PSI) Anant Gaonkar told TOI that Pernem police opposed Fernandes’ bail plea, stating that the probe was in the preliminary stage and the statement of the victim is yet to be recorded. “During interrogation, Fernandes has denied the accusations levelled against him and has said that he is innocent and has been falsely implicated in the case,” said police sources.“A police team led by PSI Parag Parekh has left for Mumbai to record the victim’s statement. She is scheduled to leave for her native country on Thursday,” Pernem police inspector Sandesh Chodankar said.Following the accused’s arrest on Tuesday evening, the US national applauded Indian authorities for acting swiftly on the matter. “While still shaken by the events, I’m happy to report this man was tracked and a formal report with the Goa police is being lodged tomorrow. I’m grateful for the Indian authorities who acted so fast and the incredible support by all of you for sharing and offering kind words,” she said.“For those of you who did not have the kindest words, or questioned my story - you are why the #MeToo moment is needed. You are why women are scared to come forward with the truth. You are why there is systemic misogyny and abuse of women across the world. I wasn’t ‘too friendly’. I got a selfie with him before he got inappropriate. I didn’t get a pic of his bike because we were on a dark road and I was scared,” the woman said.The woman further said that she gave the accused money because she was scared and wanted to lessen the chance that he would chase her. “I didn’t scream because I wasn’t sure if it would escalate the situation in the wrong way. I don’t believe the answer is wearing more clothes, not travelling alone, carrying a weapon. The answer is raising awareness, supporting those with the courage to speak up, and resisting victim shaming,” the woman’s post stated.',\n",
       " 'PANAJI: After being on display in Sao Paulo and Rio De Janeiro, Dubai, Singapore, and New Delhi and Ahmedabad in India, the travelling exhibition ‘The Nobel Prize - Ideas Changing the World’ will be on display in Goa this month. Anna Busch, who has been the curator of the Nobel Museum in Sweden since 2001 and is presently the project manager of the travelling exhibition, said that what struck her when the exhibits came to India was the sheer number of people that walk in to view it, a number witnessed at none of the other venues it was on display.Busch said that exhibition largely looks to draw in youngsters with the inspiring stories of the Nobel Laureates and said that with the number of school children that attend such exhibitions it encourages her to consider take the travelling exhibition to more locations in the country.Busch is in Goa with the travelling exhibition as part of the only second Nobel Prize Series 2018 to be held in India, after the one hosted by Gujarat.In the age of internet, Busch said that though the exhibition reaches out to students, she wishes that Nobel Laureate scientists made their presence felt more on social media to capture the attention of the youth further.“We reach out to students who are still young and look up to Nobel laureates. They are celebrities. But I wish they were more online, had Twitter handles. It would be fun,” said Busch.Speaking about the discussions that often take place around Nobel Peace Prize winners and if they truly qualify for the prize, Busch said that though she is only a producer who presents Nobel prize laureates for the contribution they have been awarded, she said that she is in favour of the discussions that are generated especially around the Nobel Peace Prize awardees. “As a producer I do not take sides. But I like that there are discussions around the prizes,” said Busch.',\n",

The soldiers responded after being provoked to the ultimate. It was an act in self-defence and to protect government property,” said Northern Command chief Lt-General Devraj Anbu on Wednesday, amid a political slugfest between coalition partners People’s Democratic Party and the BJP in J&K.\"A generic FIR should have been filed by the police … I think they have prematurely put the name of an individual (Major Aditya) in it. The FIR is an initial step and the investigation is yet to commence,\" added Lt-Gen Anbu.The Army, in fact, contends Major Aditya who was leading the “administrative convoy” was quite some distance away from the site where the firing occurred at Ganwapora on Saturday. “He was with the 16 other vehicles that were separated from the four vehicles surrounded by the over 200 stone-throwing protestors,” said an officer.The junior commissioned officer (JCO), in charge of the four vehicles, fell unconscious after being hit on the head by a stone while he was trying to reason with the protesters. “The mob even tried to lynch the JCO and snatch his weapon, and also extensively damaged the vehicles despite warnings. Given the extreme gravity of the situation, the soldiers had no recourse but to open fire,” he said.\"It was a desperate situation. The usual norm is to fire below the waist … but the civilians who got hit above the waist could have been bending down to pick up stones,” added the officer.Apart from lodging the FIR in the local police station, the state government headed by Mehbooba Mufti has also instituted a magisterial inquiry headed by district magistrate Ajaz Ahmad of Shopian to look into the matter and submit its report within 20 days.While agreeing to the magisterial inquiry, the BJP MLAs in the state assembly have demanded the withdrawal of FIR against the soldiers on the ground that it would demoralize the forces fighting terrorism. Mufti, however, rejected the demand and told the legislative assembly on Monday that the investigation in the case would be taken to its logical conclusion.WATCHShopian firing: Army files counter-FIR',\n",

Excise commissioner Ashwini Joshi, in a letter to TOI after a report on Wednesday, said Shah had hosted parties on January 8 and 10. Shah had applied and obtained a one-day licence to serve liquor for the party on January 8.“Along with the application for one-day liquor licence, he had furnished an affidavit stating that he is bound to follow excise rules. It is clear that Shah was well aware of the Maharashtra Prohibition Act (1949) and rules which mandate one-day liquor licence for his party on January 10. But he failed to apply for it, and therefore a crime was registered against him,” said Joshi. “It is difficult to believe that a citizen who is aware of the law on January 8 is not aware about it on January 10,” added Joshi.Shah was held on January 10 but for non-possession of a one-day temporary licence to serve liquor. He was released on bail the next day. Hotel Renaissance, where the two parties were held, said no liquor was served on January 10. Since January 2017, the excise department registered non-bailable offences in 11 cases. Officials said convictions are less than 1% and can take as much as a decade.Abbott reiterated its earlier stand.',\n",

But retailers in most parts of Mumbai are charging Rs25/kg, with the odd exception of Rs10-20 in some localities.Consumers have been paying exorbitant prices for this kitchen staple and rates had peaked to Rs80-100 in July 2017.Wednesday’s rate at Hirendra store in Powai and Santraj in Juhu was Rs25. Lallu Veg Store in Pali Market, Bandra, was selling for Rs28, while Shivkumar Gupta in the same locality offered the ‘number 1’ quality fruit for Rs30. “These are bigger and juicy red. Lesser varieties are available for Rs20-25,” he said.Prices in Lokhandwala Complex varied from Rs15 at Super Fresh to Rs30 at Jain Veg Store. Bandra resident Sarovna Banerjee said tomatoes were selling for Rs10 in parts of Bandra Bazaar.APMC wholesaler Kailash Tajni said, “We are getting 30-35 trucks of supplies, compared to merely 10 during the last monsoon, when heavy rain spoilt the crop. The current low rate can be compared to that of four years back, when production was good.”The food processing industry is making the most of the bounty. Varun Agro Processing Foods MD Manisha Sashikant Dhatkar, who has a plant in Nashik, told TOI, “We supply 80% of the tomato paste used for Kissan ketchup. After the price drop, we are buying more from farmers. The paste can be stored for 18 months.” Naturally, retail prices of ketchup do not fluctuate with seasonal price change.Nashik tops the five districts in western Maharashtra for tomato production and is known for good quality fruits, said joint director (agriculture department), Nashik division, Dilip Zende. “This season, weather conditions have been ambient with no pest attack. Production has increased from 25-30 tonnes per acre to 40 tonnes,” he said.Deputy director, agriculture department (Pune), Babasaheb Karale said, “Tomatoes are grown in all three fruiting seasons during the year. This season the crop turned out to be good because of a late monsoon, good availability of water and right temperature. The current harvest is the crop sown in November.’’ Tajni said the good times would continue for around two months.(Inputs from Bella Jaisinghani)',\n",
       " 'MUMBAI: Days after schoolteacher Prabhakar Macha was questioned by the state anti-terrorism squad (ATS) in connection with his alleged links with seven people working for CPI (Maoist), he committed suicide at his Pratiksha Nagar residence on January 23.ATS officials did not respond to TOI’s calls and text messages. Macha’s name was mentioned by one of the accused, but he was not arrested. In its FIR, the ATS stated that the arrested accused were trying to recruit more people from Maharashtra and Gujarat to spread their ideology. The seven accused were booked under sections of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, (UAPA).Macha, who taught at a school in Wadala, leaves behind a son and a daughter. Macha’s son, who was also questioned, works in Pune, his daughter stays in the US. Macha’s wife had died around two months ago.A family member said that Macha used to translate several news articles from Marathi to Telugu and his wife would help him in this. Soon after his name cropped up in the Maoist case, an ATS team conducted searches at his home and seized some documents. Around 10.30am on January 23, Macha’s son ran downstairs from his second floor residence and asked the security guard to call for an ambulance. Macha had hanged himself from the ceiling and was rushed to hospital. Macha was mourning his wife’s death and felt lonely, said sources. It was at this time that the ATS team questioned him. “A few days later, he committed suicide,” said a resident from the Pratiksha Nagar building where Macha lived.

       " 'Nagpur: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which had filed a public interest litigation (PIL) following pesticide inhalation deaths in the region, has alleged that not a single first information report (FIR) has been registered in the matter so far. “The special investigation team (SIT), formed to probe the deaths following the PIL, has only come up with a vague report,” said the party activists at a press conference here.Not satisfied with the SIT report, AAP has said it would be demanding a judicial inquiry into the deaths. The demand would be put up before the court during the next hearing to be held on February 6, said Aamil Patel of AAP. The party also plans to hold agitations in rural areas seeking action against guilty.Patel claimed that despite 44 deaths due to pesticide inhalation, not a single FIR has been registered. The police could have, at least, registered an FIR against unknown persons to begin with the investigations. The police has recorded a case of unnatural death, however no FIR has been registered after that, he said.Government sources said FIRs were registered against pesticide companies. On this, AAP activist Jammu Anand said it was only for wrong business practices and not for causing the deaths.“We presented the post-mortem report of Pradeep Aware, one of the persons who died due to pesticide inhalation, to the divisional commissioner (Amravati) Piyush Singh. The report clearly mentions that the death was due to contact poisoning (inhalation). A case of unnatural death has been registered, but there has been no FIR following that,” said Patel. Incidentally, Singh headed the SIT.“Aware’s case is a classic example. It’s not only in this case, but no FIR has been registered to probe any of the inhalation deaths,” he said.AAP has also demanded that the SIT members should be made co-accused in the case for their attempt to shield the guilty. “The SIT was mandated to investigate the matter. However, it has only come up with an analysis,” said Anand.“The SIT report has spared the pesticide companies and there has been only a passing mention of failure of the system to report the deaths. The report recommends action against farmers and farm workers if found spraying pesticides without a fitness certificate. This not only puts the whole blame on farmers but also restricts a person’s right to livelihood,” said Anand.',\n",

A bridge therefore will help to decongest the area tremendously,” said a senior BMC official.The BMC plans to undertake a hydrographic survey since the bridge will pass over the creek. “Through the survey, we will examine aspects like the water body’s depth. This is important as the pillars would need to be constructed,” the official added. The survey will also help in determining the best alignment for the bridge. The proposal for conducting the survey will need to be sent to the civic standing committee for approval, said officials.Once the survey is completed, the BMC will need several clearances, including Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) permission, considering that the bridge would pass close to the mangroves. The Mumbai Metro has also sought some land from the BMC at the Mahim-end due to which the project study is yet to take off.Transport expert Ashok Datar said that the bridge would prove to be a beneficial connector as it would provide commuters with another option of reaching Tulsi Pipe Road. “The project will need a lot of detailing, like if there are three-plus-three lanes proposed, then one lane could be for a dedicated bus corridor. The corridor for public transport will help the public at large,” said Datar.“A detailed study will be essential as there are several crucial aspects like mangroves, railways involved.

The PIL seeks to quash shoot orders issued on January 29. The petitioner has submitted that forest department has illegally attributed 10 human kills to the problem tigress T1 without any “cogent and conclusive evidence”. The orders were issued in a hurry without even calling police panchnama, the petitioner said.Dr Banait has stated that PCCF has himself held that presence of a male tiger T2 is found in the same area and it has also killed human beings, which dilutes all the charges on problem tigress T1.Hence, the tigress cannot be declared a man-eater without any concrete evidence. Its elimination will further hamper the next three cycles of reproduction and will defeat conservation goals, says the petition.Dr Banait alleged that the PCCF discussed only two deaths out of the total 10 incidents of human deaths — one of Satish Kowe (Sakhi) and Ramaji Shendre (Loni) in the shoot order to declare the problem tigress as dangerous to human beings. Even these two deaths are not scientifically proved and attributed to the tigress, he said.Earlier on Tuesday, Mumbai-based social activist Dr Sarita Subramaniam’s e-mails submitted through her counsel Ravindra Khapre before the high court were treated as a PIL against the shoot orders.

Later, the botanical garden was opened for general public, students and researchers on January 1, 2013. Junghare said it was university’s duty to maintain the garden as it has rare species of plants.

Kadam was elected to the BMC in 2007 for the first time. In the subsequent election, his wife was elected from Kamraj Nagar. In 2017, Kadam was again elected to the BMC as an MNS nominee. However in October 2016, Kadam and other MNS corporators Dilip Lande, Archana Bhalerao, Snehal More, Datta Narvankar and Ashwini Matekar joined Sena in presence of chief Uddhav Thackeray.Addressing the media after inducting the corporators, Uddhav, in an apparent reference to the fact that MNS is an offshoot of Shiv Sena, said nobody should accuse Sena of “poaching” as this was a “homecoming”.The MNS, which had emerged as a big player in 2012 BMC election after winning 29 seats, was reduced to just seven seats in 2017.Following the large-scale defection of representatives, BJP MP Kirit Somaiya had lodged a complaint with the anti-corruption bureau, alleging that there was horse trading in the entire episode. There was a specific complaint against Kadam as to how he illegally mobilized assets and properties by corrupt means. The ACB probed into his assets for a period between February 2007 and February 2012. Kadam was unable to explain the income of Rs 13.09 lakh, nearly 64% more than his known sources of income. “We have registered an offence against Kadam, investigation is still in progress. We will complete the procedure and file the chargesheet before the stipulated period,” said an official.Under Section 13 (1-e) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, a public servant is said to commit the offence of criminal misconduct if he cannot satisfactorily account for assets disproportionate to income sources.',\n",

Reason: Mosquito menace.The problem has assumed such serious proportions that the labourers have threatened to stop loading and unloading work for farmers. Traders have warned that they would be forced to shut down the yard if the problem of mosquitoes is not addressed.If this happens, it would probably be for the first time anywhere in the country that a trading centre will shut down because of mosquitoes.There are 700 labourers working in this market yard and farm produce from all over Saurashtra is brought here for auction. The market yard has a daily turnover of Rs 60 crore. Newly constructed market yard is situated in Bedi village on Morbi road. The villagers are facing this problem since years because filth water passes through water drain behind the market yard, which mixes into river Aji. The old market yard is limited to sell vegetables only because of congested place.Farmers come here with their produce and the labourers help him to store their produce. The unloading of the produce starts in the evening and continues till late night when the mosquito problem gets most severe. Labourers and farmers sleep in the market yard and the next morning, the produce is auctioned.President of Commission Agents Association Atul Kamani said, “If labourers refuse to work, we can’t run the market yard. We have represented to the collector office to bring out a solution to the problem. If this doesn’t happen, we will be left with no option but to down our shutters and business.”Interestingly, Rajkot market yard was newly constructed market considering the need of farmers and traders. Farmers from all the talukas of Rajkot, Morbi, Wankaner, Junagadh and Visavadar come here to sell their produce.According to traders, eateries in market yard have to shut shops after 6 pm because it’s not possible to cook or to have food.',\n",
       " 'Mumbai: The country’s largest private lender ICICI Bank reported a net profit of Rs 1,650 crore for the quarter ended December 2017 — a decline of 32% from Rs 2,442 crore reported in the corresponding quarter of the previous year. The profit is the lowest in seven quarters.Announcing the results on Wednesday, ICICI Bank MD & CEO Chanda Kochhar attributed the plunge in earnings to a 92% drop in treasury income to a low of Rs 66 crore on hardening of yields (which are inversely proportional to bond prices). On the non-performing asset (NPA) front, the bank made considerable gains with fresh addition to gross NPAs coming down to a nine-quarter low of Rs 4,380 crore.Another positive was the domestic credit growth of 16% — the highest year-on-year (Y-o-Y) growth in five quarters. Outstanding advances stood at Rs 5.05 lakh crore, which was 10% higher than the previous year. The bank has been shrinking its global loan book. Current and savings account (CASA) deposits grew 12% Y-o-Y to Rs 2.6 lakh crore, while total deposits grew 11% Y-o-Y to Rs 5.17 lakh crore.“The credit growth is due to increase in working capital requirements on back of higher capacity utilisation in some of the companies. It is also on account of refinancing of debt by high-rated companies. Of our disbursements, 88% is to companies that are rated A- and above,” said Kochhar. “We have not done any increase in interest rates. We believe that for some time the Reserve Bank of India will maintain its neutral stance, but gradually there may be an increase in interest rates. While inflation has gone up, it is still within RBI’s range.”Reliance Securities senior research analyst Asutosh Kumar Mishra said, “ICICI Bank continued to surprise negatively on core operating performance and credit-cost front in the third quarter of FY18. Its operating profit dipped by 8.4% Y-o-Y and 27.6% quarter-on-quarter To Rs 5,060 crore led by lower other income along with muted growth in net interest income.”Kochhar said that the bank has already referred to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) those NPA cases that were identified by the RBI. “We have already received bids for three to four companies in the first lot of 11 cases. For most of the cases, the 270-day deadline for resolution gets over in April or May 2018. So, we will see the outcome on what kind of resolution we will get in the first quarter of FY18,” said Kochhar.',\n",
       " 'RAJKOT: About a year after he devised an indigenous milk dispensing machine popularly called ‘milk ATM’, Nilesh Gussar a 28-year-old farmer from Talala in Gir-Somnath district has come up with a cashless version of the machine.The newly-modified milk ATM gives users three options to dispense milk — biometric finger printing, username and password or through a prepaid card. The first version of the machine accepted only currency notes of Rs 20, Rs 50 and Rs 100 denominations to dispense milk.Such milk ATMs are gaining popularity among farmers who don’t want to sell milk to dairies. They can sell milk at their own rates rather than depending on middlemen or dairy cooperatives.Gussar, a farmer of Khirdhar village about 7km from Talala, had first assembled the milk ATM for his own use a year ago. Since then, he has sold over 30 machines in Kutch, Devboomi-Dwarka, Jamnagar, Porbandar and outside Gujarat in Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh and Tamil Nadu.“I wanted to eliminate the middlemen that came between a farmer and the end customer. When I used to sell milk at a nearby dairy I was not getting competitive rates and that is why I developed this machine,” Gussar a class XI dropout told TOI. He has no formal training in engineering but had a hobby of modifying machines since childhood.According to Gussar, farmers can get one-and-half-times more price for their milk using the milk ATMs as they can fix the rate for the produce. “Farmers can recover cost of the machine within a year. That is why farmers having more than three buffaloes or cows prefer this machine,” claimed Nilesh.“Now, I have modified the milk ATM and made a cashless version where customer does not have to insert cash. The machine works by registering customers first and using their finger print to dispense a fixed amount of milk. Customers can also opt for the username and password system or a radio frequency prepaid card. Customer has to wave the card at a mentioned area on the machine following which prefixed quantity of milk will be dispensed,” he said.Gussar has assembled five such cashless machines and dispatched it to his clients in Tamil Nadu, Orissa and Rajasthan. “The machines are on the way and within few days they will start using it,” he added. The cost of the machine ranges from Rs 75,000 to Rs 1.5 lakh based on the milk storage capacity which is between 50 litre and 250 litre. Besides refrigeration, the milk ATMs have battery backup in case of power failure.Gussar’s first customer Velji Bhuidiya, a farmer from Bhujodi village, 9km far from Bhuj in Kutch, said, “I bought the milk ATM and have witnessed tremendous response. It is movable and I can carry it wherever I want. I had purchased it to sell cow milk.”Now, Bhuidiya wants to buy another milk ATM which can accept new Rs 50 and Rs 200 currency notes.',\n",

       " 'Mumbai: India has scored slightly better than the global average when it comes to budget transparency, according to results of the Open Budget Survey (2017) released on January 30. With a rank of 53 among 115 countries covered by the survey, India’s score of 48 out of 100 for transparency (as against the global average of 43) showed an improvement of 2 percentage points over the 2015 index.Every two years, the International Budget Partnership (IBP) — using over a hundred indicators — assesses budget transparency based on the amount, level of detail and timeliness of budget information made available to the public. Results of the Open Budget Survey (2017) highlight that the global average score of budget transparency has declined by 2 percentage points from 45 in 2015 to 43 in 2017. It reflects that 89 out of the 115 countries fail to make sufficient budget information publicly available. IBP states that this failure undermines the ability of citizens to hold their government to account for managing public funds.Countries like New Zealand and South Africa (with scores of 89 each) topped the charts whereas Saudi Arabia scored 1, or for that matter Qatar and Yemen scored a 0, indicating that no budget information is made available in the public domain. The average score for South Asian countries (Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka) was 46 — an increase of 5 percentage points over the 2015 survey results.To improve budget transparency, IBP suggests that India should draft and publish a pre-budget statement and mid-year review. Pre-budget statements are published by nearly 50 countries, including India’s neighbour Afghanistan. It should also increase the information in the budget proposals by providing detailed data on the financial position of the government and extra-budgetary funds. India should also provide more information, such as comparisons between planned revenue and actual outcomes and a comparison between the original macroeconomic forecast and actual outcomes.In terms of public participation, the Open Budget Survey (2017) gave India a score of 15 out of 100, denoting that few opportunities are provided to the public to engage in the budget process. Interestingly, this score is above the global average of 12. For improving public participation, IBP suggests introduction of a pilot mechanism (such as social audits) to enable the public and government officials to exchange views on national budget matters during monitoring of the national budget implementation. Among India’s neighbours, Nepal had the highest score of 24 on the public participation parameter. India tied with Afghanistan with a score of 15. Bangladesh followed with a score of 13.In terms of budget oversight, India obtained a score of 48. The IBP said that the legislature and supreme audit institution (which is the Comptroller and Auditor General, or CAG) provided weak oversight during the planning stage of the budget cycle and limited oversight during the implementation stage of the budget cycle.For the 2017 survey, documents that should have been published prior to December 2016 were assessed. India-based thinktank Centre for Budget and Governance Accountability, which partnered with IBP, said, “In terms of publishing timely and relevant information in the audit reports and year-end reports, India has scored well above other countries. Non-publication of a pre-budget statement and mid-year review in 2016 lowered India’s score. However, had the survey been carried out for financial year 2017-18, India’s score would have been higher, advancing the presentation of the budget by a month since last year has made the earlier practice of Vote on Account redundant and the full budget gets enacted before the start of the new financial year.”',\n",

       " 'Mumbai: Switzerland retained its top spot in the financial secrecy index (FSI) 2018, unveiled by the Tax Justice Network (TJN). It was followed by the US, Cayman Islands, Hong Kong and Singapore.The US has over the past two surveys, which are carried out on a biennial basis, consistently ranked higher — indicating that it continues to remain a secrecy jurisdiction. In the FSI-2015, the US climbed to the third place from its sixth slot in the 2013 ranking. In FSI-2018, it has moved one rank higher to occupy the second slot.According to TJN, an independent international thinktank, $21-32 trillion of private financial wealth is located, untaxed or lightly taxed in secrecy jurisdictions around the world. These countries use secrecy to attract illicit and illegitimate or abusive financial flows. Countries such as Switzerland, the US and Singapore that figure on the top 10 list of FSI-2018 (and are perceived as actively promoting secrecy in global finance), are also among the top 10 FDI investors to India (see table).TJN’s FSI ranking is based on a combination of a country’s secrecy score and a scale-weightage based on the country’s share in the global market for its offshore financial services. Thus, for instance, even though Mauritius (India’s top FDI investor) has a secrecy score of 72 as it accounts for less than 1% of the global market for offshore financial services it is ranked lower at 49 as compared to Singapore. India’s second largest FDI investor Singapore has a lower secrecy score of 67 points, but is ranked at fifth position in the secrecy index.Among India’s other top investors, Germany had the highest FSI ranking of 7. Japan, Netherlands, the UK and Cyprus were ranked at 13, 14 and 23 and 24 respectively. Among the notable FDI investors into India, countries such as Mauritius, Switzerland and Dubai have a secrecy score of more than 70. India had a lower secrecy score of 52 and was ranked 32, among the 112 countries. India’s ranking would be of interest to countries where its outbound investments flow to.According to the TJN, “The top two countries in this year’s FSI, viz Switzerland and the US, are the two that have been most resistant to the key policy of automatic information exchange between tax authorities. The US refuses to take part altogether. Instead, it has set up its own parallel system (FATCA) which seeks information on US citizens abroad, but provides little, if any, data to foreign countries. The US has also failed to end anonymous companies and trusts that are aggressively marketed by some US states.”As regards, Switzerland, TJN adds that the country has delayed implementation of automatic information exchange.',\n",

Sculptures of old Surat castle, sail boats, pillars of ancient Indian history are made from different types of marbles and stones. Black and white marble, pink sand stone and yellow slate stone were specially brought from Rajasthan and other places to make these sculptures.A group of sculptors like Vinod Patel of Vadodara, Sunil Shridhar of Surat, Robin David, Rajshekhar Nair, Vikas Khajuria of Jammu & Kashmir, Debasis Bera of Kolkata, Yama Moto and Kemji Toda of Japan and Li Chiara of Italy are in Surat and are giving final touches to these sculptures.All the sculptures are more than 10 feet in height and depict a story either of Surat, Indian history or Indian contemporary and abstract art form.As a recognition for their work, all foreign sculptures would be paid an honorarium of Rs 2 lakh and Indian sculptures would be given Rs 1 lakh for their work. “We can’t pay an artist. It is just an honorarium to recognize their work,” deputy commissioner, SMC, Rajesh Pandya said.Municipal commissioner M Thennarasan said, “This is a part of the project to beautify the city. These sculptures would provide an area milestone where they would be placed. More so, it would help Surtis develop a taste for art.”Recently, SMC had got 10 murals made of iron waste and scrap displayed at different spots in the city.

       " 'SURAT: After an inordinate delay, the Surat airport has moved a step further in getting limited international airport and increased air connectivity to the domestic destinations.The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has accorded the concept and execution-level approval for displacement of runway 22 on Vesu side threshold by 615 m before commissioning of the phase-II work of the runway extension at the airport.Official sources said the runway 22 has been displaced at the threshold of 615 m, which means that the aircrafts landing from there will be able to use only 2,250 m of runway of the total length of 2,905 m. However, depending on the wind direction, if the air traffic control (ATC) finds it suitable for the aircraft to land from runway 4 on the Dumas side, the pilot can use the full-length runway for landing.The DGCA has laid down conditions before giving the approval for the commissioning of the phase-II runway. These include mitigation measures proposed in safety assessment and standard operating procedures (SOPs) to be strictly adhered, civil aviation requirement (CAR) provisions be complied before commissioning of work area, separate commissioning level safety assessment shall be submitted for approval, notice to airmen (NOTAM) to be followed before commencement of work to disseminate information to all stakeholders and submitting action plan for restoration of displaced threshold to previous location in time bound manner.Talking to TOI, airport director Dilip Sajnani said, “The 615 m runway from Vesu side has been displaced, which means that aircrafts can’t use this patch for landing. This is due to the obstacles in the flight path in the form of buildings in the funnel area of the runway. However, the flights landing from Dumas side will be able to use full length runway of 2,905 m.”Sources said the aircrafts landing and taking off from the airport will be able to use the full-length runway ideal for operating bigger aircrafts like Airbus 320 and 380, mostly used in the international operations. Also, the load penalty on the airlines will not be there due to the commissioning of full-length runway.“It is due to the building obstructions in the funnel of the airport that AAI had proposed the displacement of runway 22 at Vesu side threshold by 615 m. Had there been no obstructions, we could have got the permission for the full-length runway. It is quite challenging for the airport authorities to fulfill the conditions laid down by DGCA,” a senior official said.',\n",

Close to 1.35 lakh bags of groundnut worth Rs 28 crore was gutted in the fire.Suspicion is growing strong that the fire was not accidental but pre-planned.

However, the government seems to be dragging its feet over allocation of land.ICD is a dry port from where the export and import can be done just like a sea port and all the custom clearance is done at ICD.

It is the prerogative of the government to give concession in price but not possible at my end.”However, there is no communication by the state government with Concor about the land allotment.Pranai Prabhakar, chief general manager of north-western region at Concor, said, “I have written two letters to the state government in this regard but have got no reply regarding land allotment. I am ready to discuss if state government officials call me. Andhra Pradesh government allotted us land at a token rent. Private players are not ready for ICD but we are a government company and are thinking about development for the next 10 years.”The major import and export cargo is expected from this ICD includes automobile parts, machine tools, CNC machines, sesame seeds, edible oil, groundnuts, peanuts, vitrified tiles, rubber, jewellery, brass articles, pumps and motors and fish.“If this ICD is set up, it will make our export-import easy as for IGST refund, we have approached Gandhidham customs department. If custom officials want to open our self-sealed container, we have to go to Mundra or pay high charges to custom house agents. This problem will also be solved,” said Ganatra.',\n",
       " 'Mumbai: State-run lender IDBI Bank said on Wednesday that it has narrowed its losses to Rs 1,524 crore in the quarter to December 2017 from Rs 2,255 crore in the year-ago period. The bank was helped by an improvement in net interest margin, which widened as it shrunk its balance sheet by repaying high-cost deposits.Despite an operating profit of Rs 5,225 crore, the bank registered losses as it made higher provisions of Rs 4,179 crore — up 30% from Rs 3,205 crore in the corresponding period last year. The provisions were largely towards bad loans.The government has agreed to infuse Rs 10,610 crore into the bank — the highest among the 20 state-run banks — through recapitalisation bonds by March 2018. Most of the funds will be utilised to make provisions for bad loans and the bank may issue fresh equity next fiscal to meet growth requirements and to bring down government stake to 75%.Announcing the results, IDBI Bank deputy MD G M Yadwadkar said that he expected the lender may turn in a net profit in three to four quarters. “Bottom line returning to black will be a significant factor for coming out of the RBI’s prompt corrective action (PCA),” he said. The PCA framework places restrictions on the activities of banks in terms of expansion, salaries, dividend and lending.Unveiling the bank’s programme to get back on track, deputy MD K P Nair said that the lender is in the midst of selling non-core assets. It has already sold strategic shareholding in companies that it helped promote, like Small Industries Development Bank (SIDBI) and Clearing Corporation of India (CCIL), and has raised over Rs 2,000 crore during the quarter ended December. It is currently in the process of selling its 48% stake in IDBI Federal Life Insurance and in IDBI Trusteeship Company. IDBI’s stake in its life insurance arm is valued at over Rs 2,000 crore. “If the deal requires us to retain a minority stake, we are open to that,” said Nair.The bank also has plans to rationalise its branch network by merging branches that are making losses for over five years. The bank has already identified 31 branches that can be shut down. “We have also analysed the usage of ATMs and have closed 105 machines which were not seeing much,” said Nair.The bank has been shrinking its balance sheet as part of a strategy to conserve capital. Reducing corporate loans has helped increase the share of higher yielding retail loans and at the same time reduced targets for priority sector lending, which are a drain on the bank’s balance sheet.The bank has the highest ratio of gross non-performing assets among large banks at 24.72% (15.6% a year ago) and net NPAs of 16.02% (9.6%).',\n",
       " 'Mumbai: If one looks at the performance of sensex, Nifty and top stocks on Dalal Street since the last Budget exactly a year ago, the numbers will surely impress. The sensex is up around 30% since then to a record high of around 36k, it has hit new highs on more than 70 occasions, and investors are richer by nearly Rs 45 lakh crore (or about $700 billion) with BSE’s market capitalisation now at nearly Rs 160 lakh crore, also an all-time peak.What could impress more and also give a lot of comfort to the government and policymakers is the fact that this smart rally came mainly on the back of strong buying by retail investors through domestic mutual funds. Since the last Budget, mutual funds have pumped close to Rs 1.2 lakh crore into stocks — almost three times the corresponding number over the 13-month period between Budget 2016-17 and Budget 2017-18 (for FY17, the Budget was presented on February 29, while since then the date has been advanced to February 1). In comparison, net fund infusion by foreign investors — who were the most dominant investor group in India for nearly a quarter of a century — was just a trickle at nearly Rs 15,000 crore (or $2.3 billion).With retail investors lapping up the systematic investment plan (SIP) in mutual fund schemes as their preferred route to invest in the stock market, fund managers and brokers believe that India’s long-cherished dream of having a credible counter-balance to foreign funds is firmly in place.Investors are putting over Rs 6,200 crore into mutual funds through SIPs every month and industry estimates say 95% of this is intended for investing in equities.If the current trend is maintained, very soon Indian investors will be investing over $1 billion (Rs 6,500 crore) in stocks every month, which could rise to over Rs 10,000 crore in about two years, A Balasubramanian, chairman of industry trade body AMFI, told TOI recently. In January 2017, this number was at Rs 4,095 crore, thus recording a growth rate of over 50% since finance minister Arun Jaitley’s last Budget.One of the main reasons for this huge growth in SIP inflows is what market players describe as the ‘financialisation of savings and investments’ due to demonetisation, which is getting a further boost by introduction of GST.These two reform-oriented moves by the government are prompting investors to shift from buying gold and real estate to investing in mutual funds, stocks and other financial products.Dalal Street veterans now expect the FM to give a further boost to financial savings by putting more money into the hands of salaried people and also plugging loopholes which could turn the stock and commodity markets into a much safer place to invest and trade.',\n",

The infrastructure segment, the largest revenue-contributing vertical, grew 11% to Rs 13,801 crore in the December quarter while the hydrocarbon segment expanded 29% to Rs 3,083 crore.L&T, which builds metro trains to missile launchers, said that it seeks to pursue “interesting opportunities” for growth both in domestic and international markets. However, it remains cautious as four Indian states are going for elections this year, which could slow down the decision making process on projects. Besides, rising oil and commodity prices could impact the execution of some of its projects.

TV18 Broadcast, which already owns 50% in Viacom18, will buy an additional 1% from existing foreign partner Viacom Inc for $20 million. The consideration pegs Viacom18’s valuation at $2 billion.The transaction will help Ambani to deepen synergies with his telecom company Reliance Jio. Along with the change in shareholding structure, the brands and content licence agreement between Viacom18 and Viacom Inc has been extended for another 10 years.Viacom Inc said that it remains committed to its India joint venture and is retaining a “vast majority stake” in Viacom18. The broadcast unit had posted an 8% growth in revenues in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, buoyed by a recovery in the advertising environment. Its revenue in fiscal 2017 was Rs 3,040 crore.Viacom18, when floated by media entrepreneur Raghav Bahl and Viacom Inc in 2007, had just three entertainment channels. Today, it operates 44 channels across 80 countries in six languages. The company has also diversified into other lines of businesses such as film production, merchandising and live events.

       " 'Mumbai: The Delhi high court verdict upholding Daiichi Sankyo’s plea to enforce an arbitration award will complicate the multiple ongoing deals pursued by the Singh brothers of Religare to wriggle out of a financial mess.Malvinder and Shivinder Singh have been in advanced talks to merge Fortis Healthcare with Manipal Hospitals, which is backed by private equity giant TPG. After months of discussions, the transaction had progressed into documentation work with Manipal only awaiting the outcome of the court order, sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.Similarly, the two troubled siblings have been in protracted discussions to sell parts of their financial services business under Religare Enterprises.The latest HC order would prompt Daiichi to seek custody of promoter shares in Fortis, though a substantial part of it is pledged with banks. This could lead to lenders taking proactive steps to protect their interests. “Now there’s a situation where Manipal wouldn’t know who will control the shares. Hopefully, there will be some clarity in the next two weeks,” sources added.A merger rather than a sale of the promoter shares was contemplated to abide by an earlier court order asking the Religare founders not to alienate or sell any of their assets. Fortis had sought extended deadlines with market regulator Sebi to declare its second quarter results amid swirling rumours of financial difficulties. A favourable order for the Singhs would have seen more suitors showing up for their assets, including Fortis, which is one of the largest private hospital networks in the country.Shares of Fortis Healthcare slumped 5% and Religare Enterprises dropped 3% following the court order on Wednesday.',\n",
       " 'AHMEDABAD: Education department officials across the state handed over documents of some 250-odd sets of parents — who faked poverty on paper, to secure admission for their wards at schools of their choice — to the cops, to take criminal action against them.This is the first time that police action will be taken against parents who are financially sound for forging documents to take advantage of a scheme meant for the welfare of poor children.The most such fake cases were detected in Surat, where 250 applications were found to be suspect. After scrutiny, some 100 admissions were found to have been based on forged documents.“We have handed over documents of around 100 cases, where parents submitted bogus documents to fraudulently secure admission under RTE laws,” said U N Rathod, DEO, Surat.In Ahmedabad, DEO Navneet Mehta said that the fake documents submitted by 60-odd parents for admission under RTE despite them being well-off have been handed over to the police. “Police will file complaints through the concerned education officials,” said Mehta.Last year, 62,000-odd admissions were granted under the Right to Education Act, which stipulates that 25% of seats in class 1 onwards at private schools be reserved for children from poor socio-economic backgrounds. However, complaints were raised not only with DEOs but also the education ministry, about many parents faking poverty on paper, a la the Bollywood sleeper-hit movie ‘Hindi Medium’, to secure admission in prestigious schools for their wards.An inquiry was ordered and after the elections, orders were given to initiate action. While 100-odd parents who faked low incomes and poor living conditions cancelled their admissions fearing penal action, action has been initiated against 250-odd parents who failed to correct their lies despite warnings.“Action against such parents has been initiated to set an example to others, to not usurp the rights of poor children. The Act mandates an opportunity for mainstream, quality schooling as a right to every poor child and no rich parent should go unpunished for trying to usurp this right,” said education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama.Some of these ‘fake poverty’ cases includes parents living in bungalows, large flats, owning cars, expensive mobile phones and running businesses and having incomes ranging from Rs 45,000-70,000 per month faking their incomes to be around Rs 50,000 per year.',\n",

The half-a-kilometre-long traffic jams during peak hours have become a routine affair on one of the busiest stretch of the city, triggering jam on connecting lanes and parallel roads.To escape the traffic on main road, vehicles get diverted in narrow lanes and end up clogging the already crowded Ghod Dod Road, creating heavy rush at crossroads in the busy market area.“I get delayed daily due to jam on the road and many a times it leads to argument with parents. There is unauthorized parking on road outside court since many years and it has worsened due to demolition of the old court building,” a school auto driver Satish Parmar said.The court campus is adjoining the collector’s bungalow, which again is few metres away from the city police commissioner and municipal commissioner’s houses on Athwalines. Hundreds of lawyers, their clients, court employees and police vehicles come to the court daily. Practice of unauthorized parking on footpath and road is common since many years. However, the issue has aggravated as the old court building is being demolished inside the campus and a large portion of parking inside the campus was not available.In current situation, hundreds of vehicles, including two-wheelers and cars, are parked outside the court campus on both sides of the road in several layers. The ongoing construction of bridge on river Tapi and connecting flyovers has only aggravated the situation.“There is a major issue of unauthorized parking issue outside court campus due to mismanagement in the manner demolition of the old building is being done. We were told that it is time bound. We are hopeful that the parking on roads outside the court campus will end once some portion of the open area is be made available for parking after demolition of the building,” president of Surat District Bar Association Kirit Panwala said.“Traffic police have been deployed along with traffic brigade personnel to manage the traffic. There is a genuine reason for vehicles being parked outside, hence we are not taking strict action at large. We are working to improve traffic management on Athwalines,” deputy commissioner of police, traffic, B R Pandor said.',\n",

The traffic junction located a few hundred metres away remains heavily congested during peak hours, making it difficult for the pedestrians to cross the road.Being the arterial road connecting traffic coming from Adajan, Athwa Gate and those going towards Majura Gate, Ring Road and beyond, the 2 kilometre stretch from Athwa Gate to Majura Gate poses a great danger to pedestrians. The traffic junction at Krishimangal near old RTO is so much cramped from all directions that zebra crossings are marked on the dead-end of the divider, making it difficult for pedestrians to cross to the other side.Vanita Vishram Ground at Athwagate is the spot where public fairs take place round the year. Pedestrians coming from the opposite side of the road risk their lives jumping the railings and road dividers amid the gushing flow of vehicular traffic.An RTI activist has written to Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) demanding creation of facilities for pedestrians and redesigning of Krishimangal traffic junction. In his letter to SMC, Rajesh Modi has stated that in the race to become a smart city, the civic body has forgotten to create facilities for the pedestrians like zebra crossing, providing crossing facilities on main roads etc.Modi stated that hundreds of people visit Vanita Vishram Ground during public fairs. The foot over-bridge (FOB) construction connecting Mahavir Hospital to Vanita Vishram Ground is incomplete even after four years due to the lethargy of civic body officials.“God knows who has stopped construction of Mahavir Hospital FOB. SMC should build it immediately without wasting time,” Modi said.SMC’s traffic department head Debashish Basak told TOI, “The issue of FOB at Mahavir Hospital is quite old. I will have to recheck the files as to why the work is still pending. However, we will certainly take up the work of redesigning of Krishimangal traffic junction after visiting the spot.

       " 'MUMBAI: Arthur Road jail may soon be able to lose its tag of being just another Indian jail with “poor conditions,” as controversial businessman Vijay Mallya’s defence team in a UK court described the place while resisting India’s attempts to extradite him and the government’s plan to lodge him in barrack number 12. Next week, it will become the first prison in Maharashtra to have a full-fledged gym for undertrials housed there.The gym, jail officials said, will be equipped with all the key equipment. There is one marked difference from a regular gym, though: it will have no loose dumb-bells or other unattached equipment made of iron. All the equipment will be attached to machines. This is because cement blocks used in the past by some prisoners as dumb-bells were once used in an assault.For those who just can’t do without dumb-bells, the authorities will provide water bottles filled only with salt, which they can use as a substitute to pump iron.“Such bottles containing salt are provided even now, so we are not worried,” said jail superintendent Harshad Ahirrao. The gym will have two professional trainers, he added.The demand for the gym came from the undertrials themselves, said jail officials, who feel it could also work as a stress-buster for the inmates who live in an overcrowded space. While the sanctioned strength of prisoners at this 1925-built prison is 804, at any given time the inmate population is more than 2,800.The gym will be able to accommodate 20-25 prisoners in each 45-minute session. As of now, many fitness-conscious inmates work out in their own barracks. While they can now go to the gym, a decision to allow hardened criminals and gangsters lodged in the high-security cells to use the facility is yet to be taken due to security reasons.',\n",

According to doctors at Karamsad-based Shree Krishna Hospital, Guillain-Barre syndrome affects one in a population of a lakh going by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.In this condition, the immune system of a patient’s body mistakenly attacks part of the patient’s peripheral nervous system leading to weakness, numbness and tingling eventually causing paralysis. The cause of this condition is unknown but it is typically triggered by an infectious illness like the stomach flu or a lung infection.Preema was in the intensive care unit (ICU) for 40 days under the observation of a team of intensivists of the hospital led by Dr Sunil Chhajwani. Her widow mother Usha Shah was not in a position to pay for her treatment even as her medical bill was mounting during her ICU stay.“We decided not to give up this case and pledged for a donation through crowd source funds through various means like writing letters and emails to donors and by making appeals through funding platforms,” said a hospital official, adding that Rs 4 lakh were collected through such means for her treatment.“We are grateful to the hospital which collected this fund for treatment and the doctors for curing her,” said Preema’s friend Karan Shah, adding that Preema’s widow mother earns Rs 10 per hour by working as a cook.According to the hospital authorities, it has never turned away any patient for lack of funds.Last year, the hospital had treated over 6,000 patients from BPL families and around 22,000 patients from economically disadvantaged families providing treatment at an estimated cost of Rs 9 crore incurred in hospital wards and ICUs.',\n",

       " \"MUMBAI: Placing a 30-year-old sweeper’s body at the doorstep of the BMC’s headquarters, the contract labourers’ union in the city recently staged a protest alleging she had ended her life as her employer had asked her to stop coming, saying there was no work. The contractor hired by the BMC had also allegedly not paid Sumati Devendra, a single mother working for 10 years, her dues including her provident fund (PF).In July 2015, Sadyandi Kaunder, a 25-year-old sweeper, died of undiagnosed jaundice. His parents are still being made to run from pillar to post for his dues, PF and employee insurance scheme (EIS) amount.Nearly 120 such conservancy workers have died in the past four years—not all on duty, some also due to accidents or undetected illnesses like tuberculosis—and their families’ wait for dues still continues, the union has said.Their chief allegation is that contractors circumvent labour laws and shortchange workers right under the BMC’s nose. Many contractors deprive them of their PF despite deducting 12.5% of their monthly salary for it.The BMC hires about 6,600 workers every year from 200-odd small contractors for sanitation work. According to norms, these workers must be paid at least Rs560 a day.Under the Industrial Disputes Act, a worker has the right to demand a permanent position if he/she has worked continuously for 240 days. Contractors often hire workers only for six months, and then the BMC awards the work to another contractor (the BMC’s argument for changing contractors every six months is that it wants to avoid cartelization). Though the workers remain more or less the same under a new contractor, this means a labourer works with one contractor for less than 240 days and cannot claim a permanent slot.The PF amount has to be deducted regardless of the term of the contract. But there are two hindrances to claiming it if the need arises, either for the worker or his/her family. One is that many workers aren’t given their salary slip every month, so they often have no clue how much money has been deducted and accumulated. The second is that for claiming their fund from the PF office, they need a letter of sanction from the contractor who had employed them. The contractors either sit on their request or are inaccessible -- many of them are small so they aren’t easily traceable after a certain period either -- and the BMC talks of its inability to take action against them because their contract with the civic body stands already terminated.For instance, Sadyandi Kaunder’s father, Ayyanar Kaunder (54), also a sweeper like him in Andheri, visited the ward office several times, only to be told the contractor hadn’t deposited the PF amount though it was being deducted from the son’s salary from 2011.Ayyanar suffered a paralytic attack a few months after Sadyandi’s death, which took away his meagre savings. Ayyanar and his wife Painima, who came to the city from Tamil Nadu 30 years ago to escape the drought there, were doing odd jobs before landing a contract job.“As his father himself works as a labourer we know money was being deducted for PF. But even for his funeral, we had to borrow money from friends,” said his mother Painima, who speaks Hindi unlike Ayyanar, who only speaks Tamil. Sadyandi’s employers did not always give him a salary slip, so no one knows the total money deducted for PF.Nanda Naravde, a sweeper working in Powai from 1999, was diagnosed with breast cancer six months ago and had to take a Rs25,000 loan for treatment. “There was one contractor when I was diagnosed with cancer, and a new one came in while I was taking treatment. Neither wants to approve my application for withdrawing my PF,” said Naravde, whose daughter is an MCom student. Her loan amounts are likely to further go up as she continues medication for the next five years.Milind Ranade, general secretary of the Kachra Vahatuk Shramik Sangh (KVSS), a union that works for conservancy labourers, said, “PM Narendra Modi is going to town with the Swachh Bharat mission, and its foot-soldiers are living a life of poverty and neglect.”And in case a worker dies, contractors and civic officials often turn a blind eye to his family. When Ramesh Pote, a dump truck loader, was run over by a speeding car in Ahmednagar in 2014, his wife, Janabai, got no aid. “All his documents, including his identity card, which were in his pocket, were lost in the accident,” said Janabai, who pays Rs3,500 as monthly rent for her tenement in a Govandi slum.She went to the local ward office to seek help to apply for his PF and other dues from the contractor, but in vain. “I went three times and then stopped as I could not afford the bus tickets,” said Janabai, who is raising two sons by sneaking into dumping grounds to collect waste and selling it to recyclers after segregation.Municipal commissioner Ajoy Mehta said the civic body has set guidelines for hiring and paying contract workers. “Wages are paid to them as per the guidelines, and other benefits are the responsibility of the contractor,” Mehta told TOI.However, state labour department officials said if a contractor is violating labour laws, the primary employer, which in this case is the BMC, can take action against him. “So far, not a single contractor has been removed for violation of labour norms,” an official pointed out. BMC officials however claim the question of removal does not arise as the agreement with the contractor no longer exists (most complaints are about old contractors).Explaining the rulebook, officials from the labour department said the labourers have one PF account number which is handed over to the contractor who hires them. BMC officials said the responsibility of depositing the PF amount is that of the contractor, and it doesn't concern the corporation as it is the contractor who is the employer.But labour department officials said whenever they receive a complaint about PF not being paid or deposited, they serve notices to the BMC as it is the primary employer. Action, though, cannot be initiated – again because the contractor’s term has expired.BMC officials have faulted this very methodology of the labour department for inaction against errant contractors. “They should not send us notices, they should get hold of the contractor directly. The labour commissioner even has the power to prosecute, but that has never been used,” said an official.\",\n",

The trial of the case began in 2014.During the hearing in the settlement process on Wednesday, Ekbote told the court that he could not see then who had threatened him from the crowd. He told the court that he had arguments with Dangar when he was going to tea club of mechanical engineering after which the latter left and then called him outside. However, he did not go. Later, Dangar reached there in a car and a crowd had also gathered there.

Mevani has set a deadline of one week for the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) to resolve the resettlement deadlock.The Kalyannagar settlement that had around 1,900 dwellings was razed by the civic body in 2014. Some of the families there were given houses at Sayajipura and Kalali, but this was objected by locales as most of the residents of Kalyannagar were from the minority community.In a settlement with the victims of the razing drive, the VMC had promised that those not allowed to settle in housing schemes at Sayajipura and Kalali by local residents would be given houses at Kalyannagar itself and Rs 3,000 would be paid as rent to them till the scheme came up. But later the civic body had to take the decision of giving the beneficiaries houses elsewhere as the funds for the Kalyannagar project were exhausted. Unauthorised extra work on the project led to the situation. The contractor stopped work as his payments were stopped by the VMC. The civic body is insisting that the beneficiaries accept houses at a scheme in Tandalja.Mevani and Congress MLA Imran Khedawala told VMC commissioner Vinod Rao that the right to shelter was a fundamental right and should be upheld. He said that the deadlock should end at the earliest. The delegation set a deadline of eight days for the VMC to resolve the issue.‘Register offence over housing scam’Vadodara: Vadgam MLA Jignesh Mevani said that the state government should register an offence regarding the alleged irregularities in the Sanjaynagar housing scheme.

He also threatened that the Dalit community wouldn’t allow Rupani to garland any statue of Babasaheb on Ambedkar Jayanti on April 14 if the government does not start work on Sankalp Bhoomi.Mevani dubbed the government as anti-Dalit and accused the BJP of following political untouchability as far as the community is concerned.

An estimated 40,000 illegal autos ply across the Mumbai metropolitan region, mainly in Mumbai, Thane and Navi Mumbai.The QR code system will help authorities identify such autos and deny them fuel (CNG), an RTO official said. “If we cut off their fuel supply, it will be difficult to run these autos. They will automatically go off roads,” he stated.Officials propose stickers with QR codes that can be affixed on every auto. A QR code (Quick Response Code) is a type of matrix barcode which can efficiently store a lot of data/information that can be revealed on being scanned.“We can use the code to store data of every vehicle, date of purchase and life span of the autorickshaw, expiry of permit, whether the auto has been sent for scrap/condemned and the personal details of vehicle owner,” an official stated.If an illegal auto enters a CNG station, the validator machine installed at the pump will automatically detect if there is a QR code. “If the vehicle is found plying without permit or is a scrapped v ehicle, the CNG dispenser will not provide any fuel,” an official said.The transport department plans to team up with traffic police, Mahanagar Gas and recognised auto unions to implement the system.Said Kurien, who leads the Mumbai Rickshawmen’s Union, “This is an effective system to curb illegal vehicles and ensure only bona fide drivers and vehicles operate.” He said auto unions would demand stringent punishment for errant drivers.',\n",
       " 'MUMBAI: If one looks at the performance of sensex, nifty and top stocks on Dalal Street since the last Budget exactly a year ago, the numbers will surely impress. Sensex is up around 30% since then to a record high at 36k level, it has hit new highs on more than 70 occasions, and investors are now richer by nearly Rs 45 lakh crore (or about $700 billion) with BSE’s market capitalization now at Rs 155 lakh crore, also an all-time peak.What could impress more and also give a lot of comfort to the government and the policy makers is the fact that this smart rally came mainly on the back of strong buying by retail investors through domestic mutual funds. Since last Budget, mutual funds have pumped in close to Rs 1.2 lakh crore into stocks, almost three times the corresponding number over the 13-month period between Budget 2016-17 and Budget 2017-18 (for FY17, the Budget was presented on February 29 while since then the date has been advanced to February 1). In comparison, net fund infusion by foreign investors__ who were the most dominant investor group in India for nearly a quarter of a century__was just a trickle at nearly Rs 15,000 crore (or $2.3 billion).With retail investors lapping up the systematic investment plan (SIP) in mutual fund schemes as their preferred route to invest in the stock market, fund managers and brokers believe that India’s long-cherished dream of having a credible counter-balance to foreign funds is firmly in place. Investors are pumping in over Rs 6,200 crore into mutual funds through SIPs every month and industry estimates say 95% of this is intended for investing in equities. If the current trend is maintained, very soon Indian investors will be putting in over $1 billion (Rs 6,500 crore) into stocks every month which could rise to over Rs 10,000 crore in about two years, A Balasubramanian, chairman of industry trade body AMFI told TOI recently. In January 2017, this number was at Rs 4,095 crore, thus recording a growth of over 50% since finance minister Arun Jaitley’s last budget.One of the main reasons for this huge growth in SIP inflows is what market players describe as the ‘financialisation of savings and investments’ due to demonetisation, which is gettign a further boost by introduction of GST. These two reform-oriented moves by the government are prompting investors to shift from buying gold and real estate to investing in mutual funds, stocks and other financial products.Dalal Street veterans now expect the FM to give a further boost to financial savings by putting more money into the hands of salaried people and also plugging the loopholes which could turn the stock and commodity markets a much safer place to invest and trade.',\n",

We would like states to procure as much as required to reduce farmers’ pain and we are willing to share the financial burden under the existing Price Support Scheme (PSS) and Market Intervention Scheme (MIS),” said Union agriculture minister Radha Mohan Singh.He told TOI that the Centre has, in fact, been encouraging states to procure even those farm produce at remunerative prices which are not covered under the minimum support price (MSP). “Record amount spent by the Centre under both PSS and MIS during 2014-15 to 2017-18 is the testimony of our commitment,” said Singh.Under PSS, the procurement of oil-seeds, pulses and cotton is undertaken through central nodal agencies at MSP. On the other hand, the Centre implements MIS for procurement of agricultural and horticultural commodities which are perishable in nature and are not covered under the PSS. The scheme is implemented at the request of state government which is ready to bear 50% of the loss (25% in case of north-eastern states), if any, incurred on its implementation.Flagging the ministry’s data, Singh noted that the government had procured pulses, oil-seeds and cotton worth Rs 42,970 crore from 2014-15 to 2017-18 (till January 27) as compared to these produce worth Rs 8,310 crore from 2011-12 to 2013-14.Similarly, the government has sanctioned Rs 3,027 crore for procuring perishable farm produce under MIS during 2014-15 and 2017-18 (July-June crop year) as compared to Rs 1,333 crore between 2011-12 to 2013-14.The Centre has been keenly observing states’ schemes like the one in Madhya Pradesh (Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana), Telangana (cash support to farmers to cover input costs), Haryana (Bhavantar Bharpai Yojana for four select vegetables) and the proposed one from Maharashtra where the state is exploring the option of having its own MSP as Centre’s MSP does not reflect regional realities and cost of cultivation.Though the MP’s scheme has drawn a lot of attention and positive feedback, the Centre’s focus will continue to be on market reforms through e-NAM and amendment in the APMC law and bringing legislation on contract farming to ensure remunerative prices to farmers. Officials in the ministry think the state-specific schemes are just a short-term solution.“These schemes are needed because the states failed to procure crops on MSPs. If they strengthen their procurement mechanism, the existing systems including PSS and MIS have potential to address farmers’ woes on price front,” said an official.Under the MP’s ‘Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana’, state government pays farmers the difference between MSP for crops and their average market rates. Farmers get money if they have to sell their produce in open market below MSP. In Haryana, on the other hand, the state government fixes protected price for potatoes, onion, cauliflower and tomatoes. If prices of these vegetables fall below the protected price, farmers will be compensated for the deficit.Telangana has, however, a different approach to support farmers.

It is with this premise on mind that two city-based artists—Salva Rasool and Achyut Palav—are putting up a show titled ‘Ishwar Allah Tero Naam’ at Nehru Centre from February 6 to 12. Featuring around 40 paintings, the exhibition celebrates our differences and promotes peace and harmony.Allah or Ishwar is the common thread which runs in the paintings on exhibit. “Every painting has a story behind it. My calligraphic paintings are inspired by Picasso’s cubism, and convey the humane and compassionate character of Allah or the creator,” said Rasool who has known Palav for three decades and collaborated for this exhibition over a year ago. She added that, despite so much diversity, India’s cherished pluralism deserves to be kept intact.Palav has blended Devnagri and Urdu scripts to paint so as to showcase harmony between the languages. “Ishwar and Allah are the two names of the same forces which sustain us. As an artist it is my duty to uphold the commonalities among communities. The idea behind using Devnagri and Urdu scripts for the calligraphy is to send a message that our languages are beautiful and we must celebrate and respect them,” said Palav who was four years senior to Rasool at J J School of Art.One of Pallav’s paintings is called ‘ekta’ or unity. He has used his brush to depict ekta in Devnagri as well as its Urdu translation ittihad. “When you look at it dispassionately, both ekta and ittihad in a single frame denote the message of unity.

The trees were to be cut/transplanted for construction of the launching shaft at Sariput Nagar.Prior to this, another proposal to cut 49 trees for the casting yard abutting the Jogeshwari-Vikhroli Link Road was put up before the commissioner. The deputy municipal commissioner had noted the matter was sub-judice.“If there is no stay order from the National Green Tribunal, what is the harm in putting this up before the Tree Authority immediately?” Mehta had noted. The Tree Authority is yet to sanction this proposal.In August 2015, the NGT had directed the BMC to maintain status quo. “Since then, BMC has not granted permission for any activity, including laying of electricity cables or construction of toilets for the tribal hamlets in Aarey,” said Bhathena. The activist pointed out that in October last year when the suburban collector granted permission for excavation, one of the conditions was that no tree would be cut in the process.Currently, the Tree Authority has no tree expert. Mehta said the law says a tree expert is desirable but not mandatory.',\n",
       " 'MUMBAI: Bombay high court has come to the aid of a six-year-old girl caught in a matrimonial dispute between her parents. The child had to travel more than three hours to attend school in Vile Parle after her mother moved to her parental home.Justice Girish Kulkarni ruled that the girl’s mother would be entitled to shift to a school in Matunga in the next academic year. The court said it found “complete absence of sensitivity” on the part of the family court judge in rejecting the woman’s plea for a change of school.The court was hearing a petition filed by the child’s mother seeking directions to the father to cooperate in enabling change of school.“It is not in dispute that the distance to be travelled between Matunga and Vile Parle for a child in the first standard is substantially long. The mother needs to accompany the child to travel such a long distance,” said the judge.The court pointed out that the return journey at 5.30 pm to Matunga could take more than two hours. “All these eventualities are not conducive and are not in the interest and welfare of the child,” the judge held.The couple has been staying separately since 2016 as the woman returned with the child to her parental home in Matunga. The child, who was admitted to a leading international school in Vile Parle in nursery, has continued her education there.Advocate Suresh Chandrashekhar, counsel for the woman, said the mother and child had to travel three hours every day - one hour in the morning and over two hours back to Matunga.The father, who argued the matter in person, opposed the change saying it would disrupt the child’s education. He also offered to make an independent flat available, either in Santacruz or Khar, for the mother and daughter.The court, however, held the choice could not be foisted on the woman. The court held she was free to decline “any offer made by the husband against her willingness and her psychological needs, particularly in a situation of matrimonial discord and turmoil.”',\n",

When he did this in Chhattisgarh in 2015 for alarge sum, the police went in pursuit of him in earnest. On the run for about two years, he was picked up recently from Thane station.The Chhattisgarh police had approached the Thane police as they suspected that Sethi was operating from the Thane-Bhiwandi belt. “Upon carrying a thorough search and sourcing information from informers, we found that he lived in a 1 lakh sq ft godown in Jogeshwari (west). The godown had heavy machinery, which Sethi used to install to convince investors about his ‘firm’,” said senior inspector Nitin Thakre. After shutting shop at a particular place upon realizing his objectives, he would remove the machinery and disappear, only to repeat the fraud somewhere else.Sethi started his career in crime by setting up three companies—Jag Polymers, Jio Shine Mines & Metals, and Milani Techno Engineering. He promised would-be investors that his business would double their amounts. Over 230 people fell for his clams and invested Rs 35-40 lakh, only to realise eventually that they had been duped. “He used to make his servants directors of his companies,” said superintendent of police Santosh Singh from Mahasamund, Chhattisgarh. Ultimately, a case was registered against him there.Sethi set up several ‘companies’ across the country, including in Assam, Tripura, Orrisa, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh (especially in Noida), and Jharkhand. “We believe he siphoned off over Rs 1,000 crore from thousands of investors,” said a police officer from the Thane crime branch. “We are still investigating the extent of his activities. We believe the scale of his fraud to be bigger than currently known.”An officer said Sethi is also wanted by the Central Bureau of Investigation in a few cases.',\n",

       " 'Beware of conmen, was the message to the elderly women out on the road in Trichy city as incidences of senior citizens being robbed of gold ornaments by gangs posing as policemen continued to occur freely and the investigation agency remained clueless.The latest one, in which 80-year-old N Soundiram Aachi from Kattabomman Nagar in Kumaran Nagar was cheated of nine and half sovereigns of gold ornaments by three men posing as policemen in Sivan Kovil Street, Kumaran Nagar, on January 28 underlined the urgent need to crack the whip on criminals.Going by the data available with the Trichy city police, the city witnessed a total of 31 cases of elderly women being conned by the tricksters on the road since 2013. The valuables lost in the incidents would run to roughly 100 sovereigns. Even though the incidences were considered as cases of attention diversion, police put them under the separate head of ‘stone folding’ because of the unique modus operandi.Old woman wearing gold ornaments are the prime target of the conmen. Their choice of location where there is lesser movement of people makes their job easier. They enact a drama as if they are helping the women to protect their valuables from chain snatchers and the women take the bait.Introducing themselves as policemen, they advise women to keep the jewels safe in their handbag and offer to help them wrap it in a piece of paper. Obviously, the frequent incidences of chain snatching would leave the naïve women convinced.In a jiffy, the men will hand over a parcel, which would contain small stones instead of the jewels. The cheating will come to light only when the women open the cover on reaching home. But then it would be too late. A police officer said the criminals usually keep their bikes not far from the scene of crime and flee soon after they strike. The perpetrators usually operate around noon when movement of the people on the roads would be minimal.KK Nagar police station limits topped the list with most number of the incidents from 2013 to 2017. The areas in the jurisdiction remained notorious for attention diversion cases as 10 cases were reported in five years. Nearly half of the incidents took place in 2015. Less crowded areas in the locality is one reason. The next vulnerable area is the jurisdiction of the Srirangam police station, which witnessed five cases from 2014 to 2017. The areas around the Srirangam temple were the conmen’s hunting ground. Of the 14 police station limits in Trichy city police, 10 police stations witnessed such cases. None of the investigating officers in these stations are pursuing the accused. All the cases are still under investigation.Police have asked the public to be vigil and avoid being duped by conmen. \"We are on the lookout for the criminals who belong to similar groups operating in some other parts of the state. Meanwhile, we expect the people to be aware of such criminals and keep their valuables safe,\" said deputy commissioner of police, crime and traffic, Trichy city, A Myilvaganan.',\n",

While the BJP members dubbed the initiative an election gimmick, Congress argued that all developmental works by government are being viewed in a negative light, further adding that the people were well-informed and would not be persuaded to vote for a party in the wake of welfare work being taken up ahead of elections.Government is developing SC and ST colonies in six assembly segments - Varuna represented by Siddarmaiah, Chamundeshwari wherein CM is expected to contest upcoming assembly election, T Narasipura represented by district minister HC Mahadevappa, and the rest - HD Kote, Hunsur and Periypatna.A total of Rs 6.91 crore is being spent to improve internal roads in Dalit colonies. Among them 10 are SC colonies including three in Periyapatna, and two each in Varuna, Chamundeshwari and HD Kote, a ST reserved segment, and 6 are ST colonies that are getting cement concrete roads.An official admitted though this is best way to spend money allocated for the welfare of SC/ST the selection of colonies have been done keeping elections in mind.Chikkaranga Nayaka of BJP district ST wing claimed there are 236 ST Colonies in Mysuru district but only 50 % of the colonies are having facilities like roads but the rest lack basic infrastructures.

       " 'AHMEDABAD: Patidar quota agitation leader Hardik Patel and dalit leader and independent MLA from Vadgam, Jignesh Mevani, who put up a united front against BJP in the recently-concluded Gujarat assembly elections, seem to be on a collision course over disputed land.About a fortnight ago, five dalit families of Gitapura village in Ahmedabad went on an indefinite fast at the office of the mamlatdar in Detroj, seeking residential plots. Mevani visited the protesting dalits and backed their demand.But the dominant Patidars in the village opposed it, saying that the dalits shouldn’t be given? plots as they belong to the village panchayat. They also sat on a protest at the mamlatdar office. Hardik also met the protesting Patidars on January 24, a day after Mevani met the dalits.Eyebrows were raised when Hardik Patel tweeted: “Some goons of Gitapura village in Ahmedabad have encroached on village land which has been opposed by the villagers (Patels) who also sat on fast outside the office of Mamlatdar in Detroj. Anti-social elements should not be linked with any community.”While the land issue has been resolved, with the administration allowing the dalit families to convert their farmland to non-agricultural land to build homes, the tweet has left dalit members furious. They even prepared to present a memorandum against Hardik to district collectors for his “offensive comments”.Mevani and Hardik’s friendship peaked ahead of the Gujarat polls, when the Patidar leader congratulated his decision to contest. Mevani also defended Hardik during the sex-tape onslaught and threatened to launch a state-wide stir if the Patidar leader was arrested.Kanu Sumra, a dalit activist working on land rights, said, “Five dalit families had gone on an indefinite fast, which lasted for around 12 days, in front of the mamlatdar’s office in Detroj. Instead of addressing the issue of the dalits, Hardik sat with his community members (Patels). The plot, measuring about half a vigha, was promised to dalits in 2013, when they were forced to leave the neighbouring Bhagapura village. He also called dalits ‘anti-social elements’. When threatened with a protest against him, he apologized for using such words.”The issue was resolved as the dalits agreed to convert one vigha of agricultural land into non-agriculture land, with the government promising that it would bear the cost of building the houses,” said Sumra.“Even if we disagree grossly on more than one issue, for the larger cause against these fascist forces of BJP, we join hands with each other. At the same time, I have my right to have reservations about him and he also has the right to have disagreement,” Mevani told TOI. Hardik was unavailable for comment despite several attempts.',\n",
       " 'TRICHY: Nearly a week after imposing a ban on sale of plastic carry bags having less than 50 micron thickness, the city corporation carried out surprise raids on shops suspected of dealing in the product across the city, on Wednesday.The authorities, however, failed to find any godowns storing or selling carry bags with less than 50 micron thickness. It was the first ever since the civic body and district administration jointly declared that traders selling or the banned product would be punished.As the Central government notified ‘Plastic Waste Management Rules 2016’ encompassing revised anti-plastic drive, and subsequently, Trichy Corporation implemented the same in August 2016. With the act coming into effect, the sanitary officials presently carrying out the anti-plastic drive would get more right to seize plastic carry bags having less than 50 micron thickness, and subsequently penalise the guilty.The implementation of new act did not make any impact with roads and water bodies still being used for fly-tipping every day. The corporation and district administration re-imposed the ban and declared that traders would be penalised and license be cancelled if found circulating substandard plastic bags from January 26. The corporation officials carried out inspections around Gandhi Market vicinity near Allimal street, Big bazaar street, and Big Kammala street all falling under Srirangam zone.Around 200 shops were inspected by sanitary and health department officials in which about 100 kg of banned plastic products mostly carry bags and tea cups were seized. “A similar raid was conducted across the same streets about two months ago and seized more than 600kg of banned plastic carry bags. On Wednesday, we found only 100kg of banned plastic carry bags. The dwindling number shows that awareness to avoid circulation of banned plastic products is catching up well with the traders,” A Nallusamy, sanitary officer with Trichy Corporation said.The officials said the traders found guilty of selling bags were given severe warning. District administration and corporation in the first week of January 2018 had conducted 5-6 awareness meetings for all section of traders to record suggestions for eliminating the banned plastic carry bags. Corporation officials said that traders were cooperative in the ecofriendly move to weed out extensive usage of plastic, and had insisted the public not to seek plastic carry bags from the shops.',\n",
       " 'BENGALURU: Apple’s Taiwanese supplier Wistron appears close to acquiring an over 100-acre land parcel on the outskirts of Bengaluru. The objective is to expand capacity and assemble more of Apple’s products in India, including the iPhone 6s.The proposed facility is likely to come up in Devanahalli or in the Narasapur industrial area in Kolar district, and would be one of the largest original equipment manufacturer (OEM) clusters developed by a Taiwanese manufacturer in India.“Wistron has shown interest in setting up a large manufacturing plant in Bengaluru and the state government is working closely to ensure it happens at the earliest,” Karnataka IT minister Priyank Kharge told TOI.News agency Reuters reported on Wednesday that Wistron is likely to invest $157 million (Rs 1,000 crore) to develop the site.Wistron already has a unit in Bengaluru’s industrial hub of Peenya where it has been assembling the low-cost iPhone SE since last year, a way for Apple to sell older versions at comparatively lower prices and gain more foothold in a country whose mobile market is dominated by China’s Xiaomi and South Korea’s Samsung.With the new facility, Wistron will assemble completely-knocked down (CKD) and semi-knocked down (SKD) kits for mobile phones and PCs, an industry executive said on condition that he not be named.Gururaj A, country head of Wistron India, declined to comment on queries related to Wistron and Apple. Emails sent to Apple did not elicit a response.The move underscores the importance of India to Apple. Though India accounts for less than 2% of the California-based company’s revenue, it is one of the fastest growing, and becoming more important as sales in China stagnate. India is only the third country to assemble iPhones; the others are Brazil and China.Apple has three suppliers from India, among its top 200 suppliers. These include Flextronics and Salcomp , both based in Tamil Nadu, apart from Wistron.Sources said that top officials from Wistron had come to Bengaluru last week to assess the progress made and the land deal is expected to be struck soon.Wistron, through ICT in India, operates as an original design manufacturer (ODM) offering full-spectrum solutions including design, manufacturing and post-sales support – repair, refurbishment and supply chain management. It also manages returns for its customers and logistics and warehouse distribution. Apart from Apple, it services brands like Lenovo, Dell and HP. It employs more than 1,000 people in two of its Peenya facilities, one of which is spread over 1.4 lakh sqft.Tarun Pathak, senior analyst at Counterpoint Research, said the duties on completely built units (CBUs) have increased from 10% to 15%. “In the case of iPhones, Apple could increasingly assemble their older generation phones here. There was no component duty so far and there could be a change in this. Higher duties could attract component manufacturers to India. There could be higher duties for camera modules, printed circuit boards. These could then be manufactured in the country,” he said.',\n",
       " 'Kolkata: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday referred to a ‘gaddar’ who was once in her party fold. Ironically, her political adversary Dilip Ghosh, the Bengal BJP president, too uttered the same word, albeit in a different context, the same day.Neither the CM nor Ghosh named the person they meant but it was enough to trigger speculation on whether they had a common target in mind.Ghosh’s remark raised eyebrows in his party because his reference to ‘gaddar’ was aimed at some black sheep in the state BJP, giving credence to the rumour that a section of state leaders had informed the central leadership that Ghosh could not resume normal functioning for another six months and the BJP brass should look for an alternative.“Our central leaders are very much aware of my surgery because it was planned in consultation with them. Our party national secretary Anil Jain, who is himself a doctor, monitored the surgery. They also sought the latest medical report. Maybe, some within the state BJP have been nursing the idea of replacing me. But our central leaders never told me this,” Ghosh said.But Ghosh dropped enough hints about his annoyance at such a plan. “It’s true that I am not being able to reach out to places. But I am holding meetings with district leaders and am very much in party activity,” he said. Ghosh is to meet the state general secretaries on February 2 and state BJP office-bearers on February 4. Yet, the rumour refuses to die down. In fact, it started doing the rounds soon after Mukul Roy’s entry into BJP, prompting Roy to announce at public meetings that Ghosh was the team captain in Bengal.According to sources, the rumour gained momentum on January 22 when Ghosh was rushed from Kharagpur to AMRI Salt Lake after he complained of lower back pain. Diagnosed with a prolapsed intervertebral disc, he had to undergo surgery. Initially, the surgery was to take place at AIIMS but didn’t because the surgeon was leaving for the US.On January 27, AMRI doctors issued a statement advising his discharge the next day. The hospital advised rest and physiotherapy for a month. Curiously, that day, BJP issued a communique that the party’s national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya had overridden the medical advice and asked him to take further rest in hospital. Vijayvargiya’s intervention, given his relations with Roy, fuelled the speculation about the change of guard.The Trinamool chief, on the other hand, didn’t use the word against a party insider. She used it against someone (Roy) in the context of the Tripura assembly polls on February 18. Explaining that her party had the public acceptance to contest the polls but lacked the financial wherewithal, she said: “We had a ‘gaddar’ in the party ranks. He is no longer in the party. He has now joined BJP.”“Now, Sabyasachi Dutta (Bidhannagar mayor) is looking after the party organisation there. We could have contested every seat there,” she added.',\n",
       " 'Kolkata: Kolkata is poised to be part of a global Strong Cities Network (SCN) to prevent violent extremism and help evolve peaceful communities in the city.“We have a list of around 15 cities in Southeast Asia that can be part of this global network. Half of them are in India,” Edward Jackson, who co-manages SCN, said on the sidelines of SCN’s South Asia Regional Practitioners Workshop here, the first such event in India. Significantly, Mumbai is India’s only SCN city.Launched at the United Nations General Assembly in September 2015, SCN is the only global network of mayors, municipal-level policymakers, political actors and practitioners united in building social cohesion and community resilience to counter violent extremism in all its forms. It aims to develop a preventive mechanism against violent extremism — including riots, road rage, communal tension, terrorism and insurgent activities. It gained relevance when youths from cities were found to have joined international radical groups to unleash large-scale violence.“These challenges cannot be faced and handled by law enforcement alone. The issue that unites us here today is the goal of maintaining strong cities that are resilient to threats posed by violent extremism,” said Jackson.What would be Kolkata’s advantage if it is included in the SCN of 122 cities? The city can be part of a very active network where some of the biggest security experts — former extremists — will share their experiences. The Kolkata Municipal Corporation has been chosen as the nodal agency that reaches out to the grassroots through its numerous services.“The reformed extremists are empowered to push back against the extremist narrative and prevent recruitment of at-risk youths. SCN works closely with Facebook, Google and Microsoft to stop propaganda and rumours. This will help us a lot,” said a senior KMC official.The workshop is led by Institute for Strategic Dialogue’s SCN. The event was inaugurated by Craig Hall, the US consul general in Kolkata. “The US and India are strategic partners in the fight against violent extremism in South Asia. As far as Kolkata is concerned, we are overwhelmed by the enthusiasm shown by both the state government and city government (KMC) in this regard. I hope Kolkata will soon be part of this network,” he said.',\n",
       " 'GHAZIABAD: Commuters heading towards Meerut from different parts of the city and the adjoining national capital an expect a smooth drive soon. The state government has decided to revamp a 24.5km stretch between UP Gate at Delhi border and Qadrabad at Meerut border, which runs through the heart of Ghaziabad.UP deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya announced this on Wednesday, as part of a package to revamp a total of seven arterial roads of Ghaziabad. The total cost of the package will be over Rs 302 crore, including Rs 120 crore for the 24.5km stretch connecting Ghaziabad with Meerut.In fact, this stretch of road beginning from UP Gate is one of the busiest in the city in terms of vehicular traffic movement. From UP Gate, it runs through Kaushambi, Dabur T-point, Vaishali, Vasundhara, Mohan Nagar T-point, GT Road, Meerut Road T-point, Nandgram, Muradnagar and Modinagar.This stretch was earlier part of NH-58 but had been de-notified by the National Highways Authority of India in January 2016. The stretch subsequently passed to the ownership of the state public works department.“Repair and maintenance work on the entire stretch of de-notified NH-58 in Ghaziabad will go on as usual. The sum of Rs 120 crore will be used for widening certain stretches from Meerut Road T-point till Qadrabad to six lanes wherever roads are narrower than that,” PWD executive engineer Maneesh Verma told TOI.The package announced by Maurya also includes two other important stretches of roads within the city — the Hapur Road which is used for travelling to most government offices, including GDA, district court, municipal corporation, police headquarters and the collectorate; and the Mohan Nagar-Loni-Wazirabad Road.Funding for different roads under the package will, however, be from different sources. Funds for Saunda Road, Duhai Road and NH-58 Shahpur Road will be made available from the Central Road Fund constituted by the Union government for development and improvement of state roads.Funds for Mohan Nagar–Loni–Wazirabad Road and Meerut Road will be made available from the Inter-State Connectivity Scheme of UP state government. The Hapur Road widening project will be funded separately by the state government.Work on another 4-km stretch of road in Ghaziabad, from the 18km milestone of Delhi-Yamunotri Marg till Khajuri Pushta, will soon commence. A sum of Rs 40 crore has been granted for this project from the Central Road Fund. “Several road infrastructure projects in the state were pending for clearance before the erstwhile BSP and SP governments. These roads will now be constructed by our state government using state-of-the-art techniques that will ensure their lifespan till about 25 years while cost incurred will be lesser by 30%,” said Maurya.',\n",
       " 'KOLKATA: When a young Abinta Kabir, settled in Florida, cancelled her Europe tour and instead chose to visit Kolkata with her family, she took back with her two vivid memories: the image of the Firpo Market that her grandfather Malzur Murshed (82) once frequented as a student of Ballygunge Government School between 1943 and 1947, and a bullock cart ride she took at Raichak.Abinta had promised to visit the city again, once she managed to set up her own NGO. But she never came back. Abinta was one of the 23 who lost their lives in the terror attack at Dhaka’s Holey Artisan Bakery in July 2016. She was just 19.One and a half years after Abinta’s life was snuffed out, her family is back in Kolkata, the city she so loved, trying to relive her dream through the Abinta Kabir Foundation, which supports young girls in Bangladesh.“We aim to show the world that she was a sensitive girl who had empathy for anyone she found suffering,” said Nilu Murshed (70), her grandmother. “She stood for humanity — beyond religious, economic and geographic boundaries.”The foundation now plans to support girls from Bengal who are financially deprived and those with physical disabilities. The family, through the foundation, also plans to open schools on the lines of the one they have opened in Bangladesh. Among its stated goals will be to support the ecological balance of the area, along with relief during natural calamities. The specifics on which the foundation will work here are being given final touches, with active support from the Bangladesh High Commission.On Friday, at the book fair, the family will launch a book they have collated for the past two years — after scanning reams of Abinta’s school and college assignments, her musings saved on her laptop and memories collected from friends, relatives and peers spread across Bangladesh and the US. “‘The Memoirs of Abinta Kabir’ is not just a book. It is a collection of her thoughts penned by her,” said her aunt Lubna Ahmed (52).It was Abinta’s own words that led to the creation of the foundation. “I believe that I do have a responsibility to the greater community because I am part of a community where more than half the people are suffering from poverty and hunger. I am acutely sensitive to the tremendous hardships faced by ordinary people... most problems have fairly complex solutions and require concerted planning, widespread education, class action and substantial funding,” she had written.The family says Kolkata was a “natural” choice to launch her book and the foundation. “Her grandfather spent his childhood here. One of her closest friends who unfortunately lost her life in the same terror attack — Tarishi Jain — was also an Indian. But, above all, the socio-economic condition here is similar to that of Bangladesh, and helping girls here was always on our agenda,” said Nilu. She says Abinta insisted on educating women, who, she felt, were the fulcrum of the family. “Due to my mother, my incredible role model, I value trust, determination, gratitude and open-mindedness... the purpose in my life is to become successful and hardworking... but at the same time care for those around me and appreciate the fortunate life I live,” reads another of her musings her family later collected.Almost every family member and friend has an anecdote to share to show how much Abinta practised what she preached. Nilu recalled the time Abinta told her that she was taking a stray dog home as she “could not bear the pain it felt after being hit by a car”.Her granddad Malzur spoke of the time Abinta forced him to stop haggling with a roadside hawker and pay much more for some books, as the “man was poor and needed clothes”. The same Abinta, while she was a sophomore at Emory University’s Oxford College, refused to accept her scholarship since “her family can afford to educate her”, she said.The family says the more the foundation spreads its work, the more the world might remember Abinta. “She was the fulcrum of our family. She had always expressed her desire to adopt when she turned 21. She would have been so on February 27 this year. My daughter Ruba Ahmed plans to fulfil her wish. We are not concerned about the child’s caste or nationality. We will train her to become our very own Abinta,” Nilu said.',\n",
       " 'Shillong: The war of words between BJP and Congress over the Centre’s tourism package for Meghalaya has drawn the church into the political ring in the election-bound state.On Wednesday, a day after Congress president Rahul Gandhi came down heavily on BJP for ‘offering money to churches’ and trying to ‘buy’ political support, the saffron party demanded an apology. “Rahul should apologize or withdraw his statement. It sends a wrong message to the people of Meghalaya,” president of the state unit of BJP, Shibun Lyngdoh, said on Wednesday. It was the Congress president instead, he added, who had made it sound like the church was a ‘commodity that can be bought.’The contentious tourism package that started it all was announced in the first week of January. With a Rs 70-crore package, Union tourism minister KJ Alphons – who is also BJP’s election incharge for Meghalaya – said places of religious worship in the state would be given a facelift under the Swadesh Darshan scheme. Of this, Rs 61.38 crore was planned for infrastructure development in 37 churches and the rest earmarked for development projects for 11 other religious groups.When the package was announced, two churches – the Mawkhar Presbyterian Church and the Cathedral of Mary Help of Christians – had rejected it, saying that they had never asked for funds from the Centre. “We don’t endorse or oppose political parties, we advise people on how to vote and encourage them to exercise their democratic right,” said Reverend P Hynliawta, administrative secretary of the Mawkhar Presbyterian Church. “This time, we are worried about the policies of the government at the Centre, especially about food habits. Their education policy is also disturbing. And they want to introduce here what they are doing elsewhere. That is what we resist,” he added.The Congress president, who had a breakfast meeting with leaders from various faiths and communities here on Wednesday, said there is an overwhelming feeling of ‘assault’ in the state. “This sense of assault is because BJP and RSS want to impose one idea and one perspective for the entire nation. The idea of diversity is being crushed. Congress wants the northeast to remain the open-minded, diverse region it is,” he said.In the Christian-majority state, the lives of a large section revolve around the church. Tapping into that would yield significant political dividends. “To a large extent, the church stays away from politics,” Archie Kharpuri, secretary of All Saint’s Cathedral – one of the oldest churches of the city, said. He was among the leaders invited to the meeting with Rahul here. Officially, the church has no political stance, he gave a disclaimer. “But there is a fear. This is a tribal state. There are people who practise animism. RSS is trying to appropriate these indigenous faiths. For thousands of years, tribals have lived in peace. For the first time, there is a creeping sense of hostility. What BJP and RSS are doing is terrible. They are indoctrinating tribals for mere political gain,” he added.',\n",
       " 'KOLKATA: Well into the middle of his 14-minute budget speech, state finance minister Amit Mitra unveiled a pension scheme for 2 lakh disabled people in Bengal, which would give each one of them Rs 1,000 every month. The annual cost to the state exchequer would be Rs 240 crore. Mitra named the scheme “Manabik” (or “humanitarian”) and said it was chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s “gift to the people of Bengal”.This one new scheme — down to its name — could sum up the budget Mitra presented in the state assembly on Wednesday. Focused firmly on the agriculture sector, women and the socially and economically underprivileged — not necessarily in that order — the Trinamool Congress government set aside Rs 2,000 crore of its budget for 2018-2019 for these sections. The year, significantly, will also see Bengal’s villages go to vote for the three-tier panchayat elections.That Bengal would be going to the village local-body polls this summer was, obviously, left unsaid in the budget speech. But another bit, probably far more important as a political message, was left unsaid as well: all the “humanitarian” aspects of the budget focused on sections that, according to Trinamool, had been hit hard by the Narendra Modi government’s economic policies. Mitra’s budget, in that sense, was an attempt at presenting a model alternative to the BJP-led centre’s policy prescriptions.Mitra’s Rs-2,14,958-crore budget unveiled, besides Manabik, a host of other social-assistance programmes for primarily farmers and women: there was Rupashree, a Rs-1,500-crore scheme for girls marrying after 18; a Rs-160-crore programme that would give old and poor farmers enhanced monthly pension; a Rs-100-crore corpus for farmers to prevent distress sale of land; waiver of agricultural income tax for tea sector; and waiver of mutation fees for farmers selling agricultural land for agricultural purpose.Mitra’s budget, essentially an expenditure budget, took the cue from the political narrative that his CM delivered a couple of hours ago at Trinamool’s extended core committee meeting. It also comes at a time when the Centre’s Economic Survey calls for “a radical follow-up action to address agricultural distress”. All this indicated an attempt to counter the BJP’s “minority appeasement” charge by carving out direct-benefit transfers to disadvantaged sections from all castes.The finance minister did not forget the middle class in urban and rural areas either, slashing 1% from stamp duty for buying properties worth up to Rs 1 crore, at a time when national agencies have projected an additional 15 million jobs in realty and construction in the next five years; prospective buyers, thus, get an effective relief of Rs 1 lakh.Mitra also allocated Rs 5,007 crore for the public works department for revamping both urban and rural infrastructure, a key to fetching investments. Some of the city projects include building flyovers (Taratala-Tollygunge-Jadavpur, Manicktala, Ganesh Avenue). Banerjee herself later announced that her government was identifying Rajarhat land to set up an IT hub called Silicon Valley Asia.Fund allocation for all departments have increased to a large extent because of the clubbing of plan and non-plan expenditure from this financial year, which is likely to give the state government more elbow room to manage finances. There has also been a rise in the projected state tax revenue in the GST regime despite criticism over the hasty switch-over plus a marginal increase in the state’s non-tax revenue. All this still leaves an estimated deficit of Rs 1,850 crore between the state’s income and expenditure for the next six months.The finance minister said compensating the deficit was “a constitutional liability of the Centre”. “We have received Rs 1,000 crore from the Centre as of now and Rs 850 crore more is pending. The Centre has also shifted the fund disbursal date to the state from the first day of a month to the 15th, though states have to make salary payments to employees on the first day,” Mitra said.The budget also reveals that the state plan has taken a hit of Rs 4,000 crore. The proposed allocation of Rs 64,847 crore in 2017-18 (budget estimate) had to be brought down to Rs 60,094 crore (revised estimate).But, even as the outgo on debt services is on the rise, Mitra has been able to bring down the debt-to-GSDP ratio from 40.3% of the Left regime to 33.7% now.',\n",

       " 'It is not just Shiv Sena and Telugu Desam Party (TDP), even smaller NDA allies like Upendra Kushwaha’s RLSP in Bihar and Om Prakash Rajbhar’s Suheldeo Bhartiya Samaj Party in Uttar Pradesh are asserting themselves against BJP.SBSP president Rajbhar, who is a cabinet minister in the Yogi Aditya Nath government, has turned out to be major embarrassment for BJP with his public accusations that the saffron party was neglecting its allies and the Yogi government was corrupt.“The SBSP is not getting due honour in the BJP regime... It depends on BJP whether or not it wants an alliance with us. Like in the local body polls, if BJP does not forge an alliance with us, we will contest the Lok Sabha polls alone,” Rajbhar said at a recent rally.He alleged that there was more corruption under the BJP regime than under the previous SP and BSP governments. Though I am part of this government, this is not my government... We have an alliance with BJP,” he said.In Bihar, Rashtriya Lok Samata Party chief and Union minister Upendra Kushwaha is not comfortable with BJP ever since the latter formed an alliance government with JD (U). Once considered close to Bihar CM Nitish Kumar, Kushwaha had formed RLSP in 2013 after a fall out with the JD(U) boss. He joined hands with BJP after the party split with Nitish. The revival of BJP-JD (U) coalition seems to have made him uncomfortable.Kushwaha’s party last week organised a human chain in Patna for reforms in the education sector. However, no NDA partner participated in the event. RJD leaders Shivanand Tiwary and Ramchandra Purve were present beside Kushwaha, hinting at the changing political equations.RLSP’s Bihar unit secretary general Satyanand Prasad Dangi said his party was firmly in the NDA but the quality of education was not being improved in Bihar. “Though we are concerned about the poor education quality, it is a social cause for us and not a political move. We are in the NDA and there are no talks with any other party,” Dangi said.With Lok Sabha polls due next year, keeping allies in good humour is proving to be a challenge for BJP. Shiv Sena has already announced that it will go it alone in 2019, although a section of the saffron leadership is still optimistic of a change of heart.TDP chief and Andhra Pradesh CM N Chandrababu Naidu recently said the alliance was in danger. He is upset with criticism of his party by BJP leaders in the state. But BJP played down differences with allies as a leader said, “Parties have their own commitments to their electorate.”',\n",

       " \"BENGALURU: For aspiring entrepreneurs, often the biggest risk is taking the decision to quit their current job.Corporates and organizations are beginning to help mitigate that risk by offering sabbaticals to employees to try their hands at entrepreneurship. The companies gain too, as they are able to retain the talent if the employee does not succeed in the entrepreneurship attempt.SAP Labs started a sabbatical programme in August 2016, exclusively in India, and three employees have so far taken it up. Mahesh Nayak, COO of SAP Labs India, said employees who have been at SAP for at least two years are eligible. “India is a hotbed for startups. There were requests coming in from employees. And we realised this is the best way to retain our innovative employees,” he said.To be selected, employees have to present their startup idea before a committee. Once approved, the employee can take a no-pay leave and choose to come back any time in the following two years for the same role or a different role depending on the vacancy in the company. No additional help is provided by the company.Viswanadh Akella, who started a blockchain startup Simplyfi Softech in 2016, was one of the first employees to take up this programme and is still an employee with SAP. With engineering experience of 14 years, the idea for his startup — a trading platform for cryptocurrencies — came to him while working as the innovation head at SAP Labs.“I wanted to start something related to the new technologies being developed. I was drawing a decent salary, so it was a big risk to venture out. When I told my senior about my decision to quit, he told me about this new policy that the company was going to come up with. I signed the contract that let me come back to SAP within two years if my venture didn’t work out,” Akella said.Best way to retain talent, says expertAkella’s venture has won a customer, so for now, he does not see himself going back to SAP.Last year, the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM) announced it would provide sabbatical leave to the faculty members of all engineering colleges in Kerala. The policy is being finalized.Saji Gopinath, CEO of KSUM, said the government order has come and a committee with representatives from top universities in Kerala has been set up to formulate the final guidelines. The order is expected to be rolled out in early March during a faculty entrepreneurship conclave being organised by KSUM.“A lot of college projects and entrepreneurship projects in colleges here are aided by the faculty. So the faculty will be granted a fellowship by the college for two years. We want to create an industry body for every engineering college,” Gopinath said. This, he added, should help in creating more college enterprises. Thammaiah B, MD of staffing solutions firm Kelly Services India, said globally companies have been known to give sabbatical options, of 6 months to a year, to top performers. It's given so that the employee can complete an academic course, or deal with a personal issue. Giving out sabbaticals for entrepreneurship, Thammaiah said, is a fairly new phenomena.“Encouraging employees to start up would usually come from the knowledge that 90% of the startups fail, so it's the best way to retain top talent that is enthusiastic about becoming entrepreneurs,” he said, adding that in India, the practice is just beginning.\",\n",

Police also arrested two others for posting a similar post on a social media.The arrested accused have been identified as Karajpal Singh of Zira, Gurjit Singh of Badala and Gurpeet Singh of Talwandi Khurd.Inspector General (IG) of police, Jalandhar zone, Arpit Shukla said that after Gounder’s death, the arrested accused had posted a message on Facebook, saying “Baki tuhanu kiha ke Jekar tusi ik maroge, ta Assi tuhade do marage, te hun assi tuhade 6 marage. takrhe ke riho, tuhanu wi dassage medal puwan walyo, kise da putter kiwe marida badla jaruur lawage (Be warned that if you kill one, we will kill two of your people and now we will kill six. Beware, we will show you how to avenge the death of someone’s son). He added that after Gounder’s death they were trying to generate a sympathy wave through social media and posted various posts to avenge the gangster’s killings.Shukla said Gurpeet disclosed that after passing Class X he worked for four years with his father in a biowaste management company and afterwards went to Dubai. It was there that he came in contact with Parminder Singh, alias Tiger of Chohla Sahib, Tarn Taran, who was facing various criminal cases, and further developed contact with other gangsters of the state. He said Gurpreet started helping these gangsters financially through Western Union, adding that while in Dubai he also met Neeta Deol, another gangster. Shukla said it was through him that Gurpreet came in contact with Gurpreet Sekhon and Vicky Gounder and after his return from Dubai, he went to meet various gangsters in jails and helped them financially.The IG further said the accused had established close relations with Neeta, Sekhon, Vicky and Tiger, adding that he used to look after their hideouts and handled Shera Khuban group on social media, thereby creating panic among people to collect money.Shukla said they also indulged in snatchings and drug trade and now after Gounder’s death they posted a highly objectionable and threatening post in social media using pseudo ID of ‘sarpanch’. Police said that after the death of Gounder in an encounter, a post figured in social media wherein gangsters openly threatened to kill four to avenge the duo’s killing. Officials added that Ludhiana (Rural) Police had formed a special team to identify some persons active on social media masquerading as gangsters.Officials said that a case under sections 379 (theft), 411 (dishonestly receiving stolen property), 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC and of IT Act, NDPS Act and Arms Act had been registered at Sadar Police station in Jagraon against Gurpreet, Karajpal and Gurjit.

       " 'BENGALURU: In a move to promote non-motorized forms of transport — walking and cycling in plain speak — the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) plans to develop and upgrade about 40km of footpaths around Metro stations in the city. The idea of the project is to encourage people in the vicinity to walk to Metro stations instead of depending on motorised modes of transport.The Palike has already begun the process of preparing a detailed project report. Onceimplemented, these footpaths will rival TenderSure walkways. Where possible — subject to width — the BBMP plans to lay cycle lanes to promote non-motorized transport.Documents accessed by TOI show the civic agency will develop footpaths around MG Road, Indiranagar, Byappanahalli (east corridor), Deepanjalinagar, Mysuru Road (west corridor), Jayanagar, JP Nagar (south corridor) stations among others.“It will take about a month to prepare a detailed project report once we zero in on an agency,” said Prabhakara B, executive engineer, road infrastructure -special division, BBMP. “After that we will start the ground work. Some parts of pedestrian infrastructure around MG Road station have already been upgraded. Similar work will be undertaken around other Metro stations as well.” Based on the report, work will be extended to other stations. In all, the BBMP has budgeted Rs 90 crore for the project.Urban expert ASK Pani welcomed the move, but said the civic body should have started the exercise long ago. “This should have been done when Metro services began in the city,” Pani said. “This late reaction by the BBMP has forced Metro commuters to use bikes, cars, cabs or autorickshaws to reach stations. Still, it is better late than never. The civic body should speed up implementation of the project.”',\n",

       " 'Nagpur: Leaders across political parties fervently hoped that the Union finance minister Arun Jaitley would focus mainly on boosting employment and providing better income to farmers when he presents the Budget proposals on Thursday.There is strong speculation that general elections could be advanced to around December this year. Even otherwise, this could be the last full Budget for the current Narendra Modi regime. Thus heightening expectations of a pro-people announcements with generous sops for taxpayers, small tottering businesses and perennially distressed farmers.Even ruling BJP MP and member of parliamentary standing committee on finance, Ajay Sancheti, stresses on urgent need to rationalize issues related to Goods and Services Tax (GST) and fallout of demonetization, the two major economic reform moves carried out by the Modi government. He expects sops for the middle class.“My hunch is that more than political compulsion or need for populism, the Budget would be driven by need to boost development. So it would have enough to attract massive investment, both domestic as well as foreign direct investment without ignoring the have-nots,’ added Sancheti.Congress general secretary and former MP Avinash Pande says Union Budget 2018-19 could be the last chance for Modi government to fulfil plethora of promises. Farmers, employment, trade and business, education and health, price rise are the five problem areas PM Narendra Modi identifies while expressing concern over massive unrest in the country. Currently working in Rajasthan for the party, Pande says people are disillusioned and unhappy with Modi government which has failed to keep promises. Pande expressed confidence that the results of the Lok Sabha by-election for three seats, to be announced on Thursday, will reflect the public anger. “First priority should be farmers as they constitute base of the economy,” he added.Ashish Deshmukh, BJP’s young MLA from Katol who is not very happy with the party these days, feels strongly for farmers. “The Union Budget should consider the Swaminathan Commission recommendation of factoring in input costs and 50% profit while fixing minimum support price (MSP) of farm produce,” he said adding this was the promise BJP made during the poll campaign. “Besides farmers, the biggest concern is growing unemployment. The government should provide incentives to manufacturing sector to generate jobs especially in backward areas like Vidarbha,” said DeshmukhState Congress spokesman and Budget and economic analyst Atul Londhe says the economy is in doldrums and the Economic Survey reveals its weaknesses. “For the first time, climate change has been identified as a negative for farming. So Budget should come out with mitigating measures. Crop insurance should be made farmer-friendly instead of making profits to insurance companies,” said Londhe.“The 7th pay commission has not provided middle class with expendable income. So the dream of housing has remained out of reach. To make matters worse, RERA has not been implemented correctly affecting real estate sector. To sum it up, this is the last chance for Narendra Modi regime to redeem its waning popularity,” said Londhe.Politicians’ wishlistSteps to make housing really affordable for middle classUrgent measures to arrest spiralling prices and boost employmentBringing down corporate tax to 25% for much-needed growth stimulus, like the US didTop priority to improve lot of farmers who account for 60% of the total populationMore funds for MNERGA, education, health',\n",
       " 'While last year’s budget had drawn flak for failing to acknowledge the problem of pollution and tiger conservation, environmentalists expect a better deal this year.Getting accepted as a “national crisis”, air pollution needs major attention in this budget. “The way air pollution debate has moved, allocation of substantial funds for strengthening the monitoring network is expected. We need to set-up more real-time monitoring stations and ensure that data is available to the public with health advisory,” says Sunil Dahiya, senior campaigner at environmental NGO Greenpeace India.As per a report recently released by the NGO, over 47% of the population in India is still living in areas where there is no air quality monitoring.Last year’s budget gave a big boost to solar energy and environmentalists look forward to more incentives for environmentally sustainable projects. “Renewable energy should be a prime concern and environmentally destructive projects like coal and large-scale hydropowers should be discouraged,” says Shripad Dharmadhikary, coordinator of Pune-based Manthan Adhyayan Kendra.Strengthening public transport system should find a good place in the budget, says Pradeep Maheshwari, vice-president of Vidarbha Economic Development Council. “To curb air pollution, the government should improve connectivity of broad-gauge railway network. This will lead to a decline in the number of state transport buses which are a major source of air pollution,” he adds.Though water bodies are a state-level subject, the Centre can refine the national waterways project. Dharmadhikary says, “Any allocation of funds under this project should be subjected to proper environmental impact assessment. As of today, water bodies are under a major threat as any work does not require an environmental clearance.”Unimpressed with the last year’s curtailed budget for the wildlife sector, conservationists are hoping for a damage control this time. “Separate funds should be devoted for voluntary relocation of villages. The current situation is that most of the villagers are ready to relocate but there are no funds,” says Kishor Rithe, president of Satpuda Foundation.In the budget allocation for 2017-18, the Project Tiger initiative had witnessed decrease in its funds. Hoping for a hike, regional head of Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) Prafulla Bhamburkar says, “We need special allocations for pushing mitigation measures. Centralized budget is also needed for protecting tiger, elephant and other crucial landscapes. The budget should also focus on crop damage due to wildlife.”Corridor conservation and habitat restoration should also be the priority, says Milind Pariwakam, wildlife biologist at the Wildlife Conservation Trust (WCT).Environment & wildlife wish listAllocation of substantial funds for strengthening air quality monitoring networkStrengthening public transport system to curb air pollutionFunds under waterways project should be subjected to proper environmental impact assessmentSeparate funds for voluntary relocation of villagesMore funds for the Project Tiger initiativeMitigation measures and protecting specific landscapesCorridor conservation and habitat restoration',\n",

       " 'Trounced by demonetisation in 2016 and the rolling out of GST last year, Indians across professions and income groups are now looking for some relief from the government.“The last four years have been terrible for business persons,” says Tehseem A Junaid, a hardware dealer. “The tax slabs should be reasonable enough so that people happily pay their dues and feel a sense of pride in being taxpaying citizens,” she says.Harried by the slew of taxes and the paper work involved, Sadhana Jha, who trades in chemicals, says after demonetization and GST the trader fraternity is now grappling with e-way bill. “This is being implemented from February 1 and the non-compliance penalties can go up to three times of the bill amount.“I don’t know what to expect from the budget. All I want is some relief in paperwork as business persons are left with no time for any leisure and social activity and are just handling accounts. Under this new tax regime, a small negligence can result in heavy losses,” she says.Not just those in business, others too are grappling with accounts and net banking. “After demonetisation, cash in hand has become nil,” says homemaker Neelima Verma. “I am hoping for some ease in making payments in cash. I am not very conversant with net banking and the banks are now putting a limit on the number of chequebooks to be issued,” she says.The trouble doubles when it comes to the semi-literate sector, says Manjusha Pande, a retired bank employee. “I can transfer the salary that I pay to my maids in their accounts but they find it very difficult to go to banks and withdraw the money. Going cashless is a good thought but using plastic or wire money makes me uneasy as it needs a lot of alertness and accounting,” she says.Brushing off concerns like inflation, Nandita Sharma, a schoolteacher close to retirement says, “Except for fuel, the prices of domestic items have remained stable over past four years. But the government now seriously needs to take care of citizens who have been paying their taxes honestly over a lifetime. There should be retirement benefits in form of medical aid and higher interest rates on fixed deposits for them,” she says.Business got a boost with the use of plastic money, feels Meenakshi Desai who runs a beauty salon. “I want some more relaxation in rules and ease of doing business for women entrepreneurs. GST has not helped in lowering prices of goods that we use in our salon but otherwise the grocery bill has gone down a bit,” she says.EXPECTATIONS* The tax slabs should be reasonable* Relief in paperwork for business persons* Cash payments be made simpler* Retirement benefits like medical aid and higher interest rates on fixed deposits for honest taxpayers',\n",

       " 'KOLKATA/BEHRAMPORE: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday rubbished the opposition charge of a “manmade” disaster in Murshidabad’s Daulatabad, claiming the bus driver was at fault.Monday’s bus mishap took 43 lives, one more body being fished out of the creek on Wednesday morning. The CM even claimed that had police and rescuers not been prevented from entering the mishap zone, the death toll could have been lower.“Eight persons were rescued immediately. Who knows if police and rescuers had not been delayed for over two hours, more lives could have been saved? I personally went there. Overnight, the post-mortem was conducted, the victims identified and handed over to their kin with the Rs 5 lakh compensation cheques. Such things take days, if not months, to be completed. The administration has done whatever it could, yet some people will only criticise,” she told a party meeting in Kolkata on Wednesday.“There I saw an ASP with a bleeding forehead. I asked him why he didn’t get it treated immediately. He told me he would after finishing the task at hand. Doesn’t this have any value? A driver’s fault led to the accident. It was very unfortunate but why blame needlessly?” she said.“Everybody knows who the instigators were. Why were the DM and SP not allowed to reach the spot for two hours? Let not our decency be mistaken for weakness.”The CM’s statement followed allegations by Left Front and Congress that administrative lapses led to the accident and a judicial inquiry should be ordered.Acting on cue, the Murshidabad administration lodged two FIRs, the first relating to the deaths and the other for rioting and arson at Daulatabad PS.The state PWD has issued an order saying crash barriers will need to be set up urgently on both sides of all bridges set up by it by March 31. It was issued keeping in mind the accident, sources said.',\n",
       " 'Nagpur: City MP and Union minister for road, transport and highways Nitin Gadkari is expecting a budgetary provision to start a lifeline project along the national highways. Gadkari’s office claims with the project, 80% of accidental deaths on highways can be prevented.The project will cost Rs1 lakh crore in which government stake will be 50% while remaining will be arranged through Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) funds from private players.Gadkari’s adviser Dr Viral Kamdar told TOI, “Every year about one lakh deaths occur on national highways. Of them, 80% are avoidable if the patient receives timely medical care.”As per the plan, an ambulance will be available at every 37km, one primary care centre (Level3) at every 40km, specialized centre (level 2) at every 120km, besides 750 super-speciality centres (Level 1). “Apart from trauma care to accident victims, the hospitals will also cater to areas adjoining the highways and help to reduce the infant mortality rate and maternal mortality rate,” said Kamdar.The city has high expectations regarding cancer care and medicines. Shailesh Joglekar, secretary of Dr Aabaji Thatte Seva Aur Anusandhan Sanstha which is developing National Cancer Institute (NCI), said that cancer drugs should be exempted from Goods and Services Tax (GST).During the VAT regime, cancer drugs and equipment were tax-free in the state. “Now, there is 5% GST on some medicines while on others it is 12%, including life saving drugs. There should be some relief on import duty. The cancer diagnostic equipment are already too costly, and the heavy import duty makes it even worse,” said Joglekar.Private hospitals expect ‘priority industry’ status to the private health sector to reduce the per bed cost. Vidarbha Hospital Association (VHA) secretary Dr Anup Marar said, “Private health sector of the country serves 80% of population which includes poor and needy who are forced to approach private hospitals since government hospitals are not up the mark. Also, budgetary provision for the health care sector, which could strengthen the government hospitals, is shrinking every year.”Marar said, “The cost of taxes and high duties is unfortunately being transferred to patients and the private health care sector is being blamed for this.”Resident Doctors from Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) feel that while there is a regular flow of infrastructure funds, the hospital lacks basic drugs which patients are compelled to buy from outside. A resident doctor said, “GMCH performs over 100 blood transfusions each day but patients are made to buy the transfusion kit from private pharmacies.” According to Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD) of GMCH, resident doctors haven’t got the daily allowance from the last one-and-a-half year. A doctor said, “The government owes Rs13,000 to each resident doctor of state GMCs.”Expectations* Instead of infrastructure funds, resident doctors expect Rs1.5 crore particularly for medicines* GST exemption on medicine and equipment related to cancer and kidney diseases* Private health care sector be given priority industry set-up in order to receive tax relief. Ultimately, this will bring down the cost per bed',\n",
       " 'With hours to go for the Union Budget to be announced of which the railways is also a part now, finance minister Arun Jaitley is expected to give major infrastructure boost to Vidarbha region.“The budget is expected to give approval to semi-high speed corridor between Howrah-Mumbai wherein trains will run at 160 kmph. Work on semi-high speed tracks is already going on between Nagpur-Bilaspur and Nagpur-Secunderabad,” said SECR DRM Amit Kumar Agarwal.The Economic Survey released on January 29 also hinted at ‘transformative’ steps in the railway sector. “If there is no announcement regarding any new trains, Nagpur Central Railway expects to get approval to around Rs300 crore boost for railway safety and traffic upgradation projects. The works have already been approved at headquarters-level,” said DRM Brijesh Kumar Gupta.Agarwal expected big allocation for conversion of Itwari-Nagbhid narrow gauge line, especially after Maharashtra government agreeing to share 50% of the Rs738 crore project cost. Till now, the project was held-up. “We expect good allocation for passenger amenities, signalling, line conversion and safety issues like track maintenance and OHE equipment. We have plans to procure 100 tower wagons and allocation is expected. Wadsa-Gadchiroli line is set to get a major boost. There were surveys done for other lines too, I hope these projects are approved,” he said.“Railway minister Piyush Goel has already said funds will not be a constraint for ongoing projects like third and fourth line. We even expect to commission one of the third line section in 2018-19,” said Gupta.“Considering the central location, it is high time Nagpur is declared a full-fledged railway zone. Union minister Nitin Gadkari needs to pitch in to convert Godhni station into a terminus as Nagpur has become congested,” said Pravin Datke, former mayor.Consumer rights activist Avinash Prabhune expected Jaitley to make some big announcements for safe travel. “From 2017 till date, there have been over 50 train accidents in which over 55 persons have died and over 190 injured.

       " 'Though Mahametro is yet to finalize the detailed project report (DPR) for Metro Rail phase-II (worth around Rs10,000 crore), former mayor and corporator Pravin Datke, who coordinates with Union minister Nitin Gadkari for city’s infrastructure projects, said a formal announcement is likely in the budget.“Mahametro has prepared a tentative DPR of phase-II which will be present ed on February 3. Phase-II is very crucial as it make travelling to the outskirts faster,” he said.Also, Mahametro has sought funds of Rs2,100 crore for Metro Rail in 2018-19. “This will be a very important fiscal for Metro Rail as we have to complete works on two corridors and launch commercial operation. Flow of funds is very important to maintain the project’s momentum,” an official said.Datke added that the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) is likely to get approval for the Nag river rejuvenation and beautification plans. “Long-term loans from Japan International Cooperation Agency (long term of Rs1,252.33 crore) and AFD France Rs1,054.58 crore of the total estimate of Rs1,600 crore is assured. The Centre will bear 60% cost of these two projects. The two plans may not feature directly in the budget but is likely to be approved in heads/schemes related to water bodies conservation,” he said.An NMC official said a proposal seeking funds of Rs120 crore — Rs105 crore for procurement of electric-run buses and Rs15 crore for setting up charging stations — has been submitted to the ministry of heavy industries and is likely to be passed in the budget.“The fate of the proposal will depend on funds allocated for ministry of heavy industries’ FAME India Scheme (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid & Electric Vehicles in India),” he said.Gadkari had proposed three projects — inter model station (IMS) at Ajni, logistic hub at Khapri at an estimated cost of Rs1,400 crore and Nagpur-Hyderabad-Bengaluru Expressway at Rs35,000 crore under the Bharat Mala Project. It remains to be seen how the much money is allocated to the project.The NMC had got approval for projects worth around Rs4,200 crore under the centre’s Smart City Mission, Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) and Swachh Bharat Mission. Works on these projects are likely to begin from the coming fiscal. Therefore, annual allocation of funds for these schemes will be vital for the city.The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has started works on various developmental projects — Outer Ring Road, flyovers at Pardi, Sadar, railway over bridge at Chinchbhuvan. Works on few more projects like cement concrete of Kamptee road, two railway under bridges in East Nagpur, flyover in Mahal, on Amravati road etc are likely to begin.

       " 'NEW DELHI/ SRINAGAR: The Army on Wednesday asserted that its soldiers had only opened “controlled fire in self-defence” after issuing enough warnings to the violent mob pelting stones on its convoy at Shopian in south Kashmir on Saturday, which left three civilians dead and seven soldiers injured.The Army on Sunday had filed a “counter-FIR”, detailing how four of its vehicles that were separated from the 16 others in the administrative convoy were surrounded and attacked by violent protesters, in response to the state police lodging an FIR charging a Major and other personnel from the 10 Garhwal Rifles battalion with murder and attempt to murder under the Ranbir Penal Code for the incident at Ganwapora Chowk.“We have done our internal inquiry. The soldiers responded after being provoked to the ultimate. It was an act in self-defence and to protect government property,” Northern Command chief Lt-General Devraj Anbu said on Wednesday, amid a political slugfest between coalition partners People’s Democratic Party and BJP in J&K.“A generic FIR should have been filed by the police… I think they have prematurely put the name of an individual (Major Aditya) in it. The FIR is an initial step and the investigation is yet to commence,” he added.The Army, in fact, contended that Major Aditya, who was leading the administrative convoy, was quite some distance away from the site where the firing occurred on Saturday. “He was with the 16 other vehicles that were separated from the four vehicles surrounded by the over 200 stone-throwing protesters,” an officer said.The junior commissioned officer (JCO) in charge of the four vehicles fell unconscious after being hit on the head by a stone while he was trying to reason with the protesters. “The mob even tried to lynch the JCO and snatch his weapon, and extensively damaged the vehicles despite warnings. Given the extreme gravity of the situation, the soldiers had no recourse but to open fire,” the officer said.“It was a desperate situation. The usual norm is to fire below the waist… but the civilians who got hit above the waist could have been bending down to pick up stones,” he added.Apart from lodging an FIR in the local police station, the state government has instituted a magisterial inquiry and sought a report within 20 days.While agreeing to the magisterial probe, BJP MLAs have demanded withdrawal of the FIR against soldiers on the ground that it would demoralise the forces fighting terrorism. The CM has, however, rejected the demand.',\n",
       " 'Industrialists of the region were badly hit by introduction of GST and demonetisation and now want the government to compensate them by slashing GST and corporate tax rates in the budget. They also want it to take concrete steps to actually increase ease of doing business.Chandramohan Randhir, president of MIDC Industries Association Hingna, wants GST rates to be drastically slashed in some cases. “Earlier, job work attracted 5% central excise. Now it attracts 18% GST, which should be slashed. Plastic processing units used to be levied 6% central excise but now they attract 18% GST. Most of these units are small-scale and they have laid off people or have closed down altogether unable to bear losses,” he said.The industrialist wants government to start a steel development centre in Hingna MIDC. Randhir also wants income tax exemption limit to be raised and income tax rates to be reduced.Hemant Ambaselkar, former president of Butibori Manufacturers Association (BMA), feels that government should take concrete steps to make doing business easy. “They have made several announcements regarding ease of doing business but nothing has changed on ground. We face the same trouble in starting a new unit that we used to face a year ago. Land transfer should be made easier and it should not be difficult to hire and fire employees,” he said.Ambaselkar further said that stamp duty should be reduced. “Five years ago if the duty was Rs10, it has now increased to Rs100. This is the reason for reluctance of companies to take over sick industries. Thousands of crores are stuck up in sick industries,” he added.Pravin Tapadia, former president of Vidarbha Industries Association (VIA), said that corporate tax should be slashed by at least 2 to 3%. “Long-term capital gains should continue. Ease of doing business should be real and not restricted to announcements. Funds must be sanctioned for power sector so that rural areas get round the clock electricity. This will boost business. One time settlement (OTS) must be introduced for small scale industries and the promoter must be allowed to continue running the unit,” he added.Madhusudan Rungta, president of MIDC Industries Association Chandrapur, said the industry suffered a lot due to GST and it expected relief on major fronts this time. “This is an election budget and we hope that GST rates will be slashed on industrial products. Law will be made stricter for delayed payment as industry always suffers from this practice. There should sops for small scale industries,” he added.Industry wish listReduce GST rates on job work, plastic processing and industrial products in generalReduce corporate tax by at least 2 to 3%Increase ease of doing business in real senseStart steel development centre at MIDC HingnaReduce income tax rates to boost consumer spendingReduce stamp duty to realistic levelsIntroduce OTS for small scale industriesEnsure round the clock power in rural areas to boost business',\n",
       " \"Though the scientist community is mostly content with funding from the central government, it is hoping that the Union Budget on Thursday brings in more cheers to the research and development field.Amit Majumdar, former regional director of Atomic Minerals Directorate for Exploration and Research, said, “The government’s focus is very clear and our mandate is pretty much chalked out. I am confident that the budget will reflect this government’s commitment to the scientific community.”He added that the steady funding has ensured that India is on its way to securing almost 400 years of nuclear energy resources. “Our nuclear power project is unique in the world because we are using thorium. The government is well aware that we are now on the threshold of surging ahead in technology and ultimately starting commercial use of nuclear energy. Once we achieve that, it will mean centuries of secured power for our country and this is something this government will definitely consider in its budgetary allocation,” said Majumdar.JS Pandey, chief scientist and science secretary at Neeri, said, “I think the government will continue its focus on science and its benefits to society at large. There is an overall view in the government that research and development must have societal benefits. Whatever technology you are inventing or researching must have social applications. I am sure the budget will be oriented in such a way that ultimate benefits of all scientific allocation reach the common man.”Arun Chaturvedi, former director of National Bureau of Soil Survey, agreed that the focus should be to push agriculture extensions. “What's missing is the impact of what we in the scientific community call ‘lab to land’ initiatives. I believe this has to be emphasized much more now through new scheme announcements. Because we have limited land and the land quality is also not the best always, so focus has to be on diversification. It's like you give land to tribals for rehabilitation but we have to also see that what quality of land we are giving them,” said Chaturvedi.Experts like PD Majumdar, former adviser to ISRO and DST, believe the space research segment is still placed comfortably in the budgetary priority. “Generally the funding from central government has been good and I can say that even for the various fields in the scientific community. ISRO has been very well supported by the government and as a result you see that we are making various forays into space research and technology. We are helping foreign countries send their satellites into orbit.”Majumdar advised caution while funding certain projects. “The government must be careful when deciding on funding to certain projects or initiatives because there have been cases of a few of them being stopped midway. Even for established institutes, certain laboratories are closing down so funding for them should also be done after due diligence,” said Majumdar.EXPECTATIONS* Budget should be focused on scientific initiatives that have societal benefits* Diversification within any field of research should be encouraged* Nuclear power research funding should be steady to help our energy needs* Fund allocation for certain faltering initiatives must be reviewed\",\n",
       " 'City educationists have many expectations from Arun Jaitley’s budget. They have reminded the FM that he had announced big institutions like AIIMS and NIPER for the city. Now, they expect that he should allocate more such prestigious institutions like National Institute of Design (NID) to the city to make it a global education hub.“We’re thankful to him for allocating institutions of national repute. However, there is hardly any progress after that, primarily due to funds shortage. NIPER hasn’t moved beyond land allotment in Kaldongri on Wardha Road after two years of announcement. While AIIMS work has just started after three years of its announcement in NDA’s first budget in 2014,” said joint director for technical education Gulabrao Thakre.The story of IIM, which is still operating from the rented premises, is no different, he points out. “When we finalized VNIT for setting up the premier B-school, it was decided that it would be moving to its permanent premises of 100 acres in Mihan. However, nothing has moved since then and it would now take at least five more years if construction starts now,” said Thakre.“We’ve demanded an Indian School of Mining in Chandrapur, like the one in Dhanbad, and a National Dairy Research Institute in Bhandara. While Chandrapur witnesses heavy mining activities, Bhandara is the largest producer of milk in Vidarbha. We even met union ministers concerned and handed over representations to them in this regard. We’ve also demanded Central Industrial Security Force’s training institute here, as the government was exploring options for it,” said Devendra Parekh, Vidarbha Economic Development (VED) Council president.Senior academician Dr Vedprakash Mishra firmly believes that the centre should introduce five-year plan for development of health care and medical education in the country. “My only fear is that institutions like AIIMS shouldn’t just be hypothetical imagination but should soon become a reality so that large number of patients from this part of the country should benefit. Even the GMCs should be developed on same level,” he said.The school education sector is most neglected, according to some experts, and the government needs to overhaul the system by infusing funds. “Every year, 6% of GDP funds are allocated to this sector, but hardly over 2.5% is spent. The schools, imparting education in vernacular languages, are facing most of the brunt, as the government don’t release the grants on time. Even specified funds are not released fully, which adversely affects the quality of education,” said Ashok Gavahankar, general secretary of Vidarbha Junior College Teachers’ Association.Education wish listMore institutions like NID, ISM & NDRIExpedite shifting of IIM & IIIT to permanent campusesInfuse funds for setting up & starting prestigious AIIMSAllocate funds for starting NIPER from KaldongriOverhaul school education sector with more funds',\n",

There has been much turbulence in the hinterland, especially the central Indian region and government will have to come up with major sops for farmers. BJP also desperately needs to please farmers keeping in account elections next year, activists said.“A lot is expected for agriculture. There has not been much to cheer for the farmers during the current regime. If the BJP wants to prevent losses in elections, then farmers’ issues need to be at the forefront,” said Kishore Tiwari, chairman of Vasantrao Naik Shetkari Swavalamban Mission (VNSSM). VNSSM is a state government think-tank on farmers’ welfare in agrarian crisis-hit areas of Vidarbha and Marathwada.Tiwari said, “It is the last chance for government to come up with a pro-farmer policy. Else, it would be blamed for not keeping the poll promises of 2014. The minimum support price (MSP) on agriculture produce needs to be fixed by adding 50% margin of profit to the cost of production. The subsidies which have been done away with need to be brought back. The government is mistaken to consider farmers can survive in the open market without any support.”There are heavy subsidies even in developed countries like US and Europe. There has to be an approach on giving direct subsidies on fertilizer and other farm inputs and globalization in agriculture needs to be discouraged, he said.Amitabh Pawde, an activist from the city, said even as a higher MSP has been proposed by the state government, the Centre has declared a lower amount. The gap needed to be filled.“Demand for fruits can be created by including it in the menu for mid-day meals in schools. Similarly, to boost cotton demand cotton fabric should be made mandatory for all government uniforms. A comprehensive crop insurance should be available and agriculture-based weather stations need to be set up at taluka level,” said Pawde.“A massive effort is needed for getting a proper title for their holdings to the farmers. Such efforts are being undertaken in countries like Peru. Availing benefits of a number of government schemes including loans and subsidies depends on the land title held by a farmer. Lack of proper documentation prevents a large section from getting the benefits. NGOs can be provided funds for getting titles of farmers cleared,” said Moin Qazi, a development finance expert.Qazi said funds needed to be allocated for land rejuvenation also. A major side-effect of the green revolution is that the soil quality had come down which was affecting the yield. Since it was beyond the farmers’ means, government should make efforts on soil rejuvenation, he said.(in a nutshell)The MSP needs to increased by including 50% profit marginBring back farm input subsidiesFund allocation for soil rejuvenationFunds to give proper title for farm holdingsDiscourage globalisation in agriculture',\n",

Expected to be a populist budget, it is felt that Jaitley may come up with some relaxations for individual taxpayers.Chartered accountants in the city said the budget should also make the provisions related to capital gains tax simpler and ease the penalties.Rajesh Loya, former chairman of Nagpur branch of Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI), said it was expected the government should propose a 20% increase in the basic exemption limit at least. The options for tax-specific savings should be widened, he said.“There is a major need to rationalize the provisions related to capital gains. At present, there is a lot of litigation with the department on account of confusion over different provisions. There needs to be clarity. These include capital cost, cost of acquisition, cost of improvement, and definition of long-term assets,” he said.A penalty of 120% was imposed in the last budget for unexplained income found during raids or similar actions. It starts with 60% rate of tax on which 30% penalty is added and along with surcharges, the final rate comes to 120%, he said. “This is too burdensome. Sometimes tax is not paid on account difference in interpretation of the law between the assessee and department officials. Lack of awareness is also one of the reasons,” said Loya.“The budget is expected to be focused on common man, with some measures expected for the corporate sector too,” said Naresh Jhakotia, a chartered accountant practising direct taxes. The government offers an interest subsidy up to Rs1.5 lakh for low cost homes under its housing for all scheme. The limit needs to be increased, he said.Kailash Jogani, also a chartered accountant, said there was much buzz about the term for long term capital gains being changed to 24 months as against 36 months. “This has already been done for land and building. It is being speculated the tenure for other assets may also be reduced to 24 months in order to bring parity. Apart from measures for individual taxpayers, the finance minister must also come up with certain relaxations on minimum alternate tax (MAT) and dividend distribution tax (DDT),” he said.“Not much can be expected on indirect taxes as goods and services tax (GST) is practically out of purview of budget.

After efforts to garner an extension from the Centre for incumbent chief secretary SP Singh failed, the state bypassed three officers senior to him and appointed Joshi as the new CS. He will also hold irrigation as additional charge and will be in service till December 2019.An engineer from IIT-Roorkee, Joshi did his post-graduation at IIT, Delhi, and received doctorate in 2010. The 1984-batch IAS officer served as district collector of Krishna district and secretary in information technology, municipal administration, health and irrigation departments. Hailing from Bareilly, Uttar Pradesh, Joshi studied Telugu as third language in school.His book on ‘Management of Transboundary Water Resources’ is a reference book for UN. He has the distinction of being associated with United Nations Conference on Environment and Development at Rio de Janeiro and the United Nations Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg. As a key negotiator for India, Joshi travelled to many countries and participated in several bilateral and multinational negotiations.“I am grateful to the chief minister for giving me the opportunity to serve the state as chief secretary. I will rededicate myself to serve people to the best of my capabilities. My priority subject will be completion of Kaleswaram project,” Joshi told TOI after taking charge.In appointing Joshi, TRS government bypassed MCRHRD director general BP Acharya, Binoy Kumar, who is on central deputation and Ranjeev Acharya from the higher education department.

Interestingly, 11% women who worked in past year were self employed.Data collected by the survey shows employment levels have come down to 24% in 2015-16 for women, as compared to 36% in 2005-06. The figure is less stark for men but there is still a drop, with percentage currently employed down from 85% to 75% in the past decade.The term ‘employed’ in the 2015-16 NFHS-4 is for respondents who were employed in the seven days before the survey. It included respondents who did not work in the past seven days but who are regularly employed and were absent from work for leave, illness, vacation, or any other reason.“70% of women and 19% of men reported that they were not employed in the 12 months preceding the survey,” the survey said.The survey found that men are three times as likely to be currently employed as women. The occupations have been categorised as professional, technical, administrative, managerial, clerical, sales and services, skilled manual, unskilled manual and agriculture.Both women and men are most commonly employed as agricultural workers (48% of women and 32% of men), followed by production workers (21% and 32%, respectively).A large majority of employed women (81%) and men (90%) earned cash for their work, but 15% of women and 8% of men did not receive any payment.Jammu & Kashmir (14%), and Bihar and Assam (15% each) have the lowest percentage of women currently employed.

       " 'AHMEDABAD: Despite an increase in the area sown with cotton, Gujarat may see lower cotton production than estimated for 2017-18, as pink bollworm infestations have affected the crop yield in the state, say agriculture experts and industry players. They, however, see a limited downside, as the infestation occurred at later stages of the crop cycle.“Cotton yield in Gujarat may take a 15% hit this year due to the pink bollworm pest attack. The average per hectare yield of cotton in the state is estimated to fall from 510-520kg a hectare to 480kg a hectare,” said a city-based cotton expert.M V Variya of the Junagadh Agriculture University (JAU), who surveyed pest-affected cotton fields, said, “Saurashtra alone has seen 40% of the crop infested, while 30% of cotton fields in other parts have suffered damage from pink bollworm. We are expecting the crop to be more than last year, but it will certainly be about 15% less than what was estimated at the start of the season.”Experts, however, also made it clear that the pink bollworm infestation in Gujarat is not as severe as in Maharashtra, as the pest struck fields at the end of the harvesting (in the second half of December 2017) after the first and second pickings by the farmers. Maharashtra has cut its cotton output estimate by 37% from the September forecast due to the worm attack.Learning from their experience in kharif 2016-17, when pink bollworm hit cotton farms hard, Gujarat farmers took several measures to control the pest this year, which helped protect their crop.“After the first picking, farmers did not take adequate measures and consequently the crop was infected with pink bollworm. In many cases, the crop was infested after two pickings,” added K L Dobariya, a researcher at JAU.Data from the state agriculture department shows that cotton acreage in Gujarat increased to 26.42 lakh hectares in the kharif season of 2017-18 from 24.04 lakh hectares in the previous season.According to industry estimates, cotton production in the state was earlier estimated to reach 101 lakh bales in 2017-18. However, the infestation may keep the state from achieving that mark now.',\n",
       " 'AHMEDABAD: Four activists from Ahmedabad have approached the Supreme Court demanding that the process to pass the bill on triple talaq be immediately stayed, and that the bill be scrapped because it introduces penal action in a civil law. Danish Qureshi, Jamilabanu Pathan, Nishant Varma, and Rajiyabanu Pathan have filed a writ petition in the apex court against the proposed law, terming it “illegal”. Their contention is that the Centre is trying to enact an illegal law using the Supreme Court’s order.The petitioners challenged the provision of punishment in the bill, saying that it has been done with mala fide intent by the government. In their petition, Qureshi and others have stated that there was no mention of introducing a penal provision in the Supreme Court order prohibiting unilateral triple talaq. Even Sharia laws do not prescribe criminal procedure in this context, the petitioners said. The petitioners said that the government can legislate such a law, but it should not make the Supreme Court order its base. There is no existing civil law that has the provision of penal action, the petitioners said. The activists have contended that the bill has been accepted by the states as well as the Lok Sabha without any objection to the introduction of penal action. The bill is pending in the Rajya Sabha, but nobody is raising the real issue, they said. The Supreme Court is not intervening either though the government is projecting the bill as though it was drafted on the Supreme Court order, the petitioners said.The petitioners have prayed for the formation of a court committee to determine whether the government has even understood the Supreme Court order passed in August last year or if it has gone beyond court directives. The petition is based upon the Supreme Court order which said that the Constitution protects a faith and not practice, and penal punishment or procedure is never a part of Islamic faith. “The central government is hell bent on creating an illegal law by misusing the Supreme Court order, mistreating the order for political gains as well as harassing Muslims in India,” said Varma, who plans to argue the petition as party-in-person.The petition was filed in the Supreme Court on Tuesday, and petitioners expect a hearing in a week’s time.',\n",
       " 'HYDERABAD: City-based LV Prasad Eye Institute has developed mini human eyes in test tube with stem cells. Though, it may take a few more years to develop the complete eye through stem cells that could readily be used for transplant, the present development in LV Prasad Eye Institute’s research laboratory holds promise for the future. The technology could also be utilised for treating critical eye injuries.The institute has been conducting research on stem cells to develop human eye for around 15 years. It now succeeded in developing complex 3D corneal organoids, which are miniature versions of a larger organ developed in a test tube. These organoids developed by the institute are capable of recapitulating steps of normal corneal development.Results of stem cell research were presented at ongoing International Congress of Cell Biology (ICCB – 2018) here by Dr Indumathi Mariappan, research scientist at Sudhakar and Sreekanth Ravi Stem Cell Biology Laboratory at LV Prasad Eye Institute (LVPEI).Pluripotent stem cells to solve eye problemsHer laboratory is involved in basic and translational research towards addressing problems of retinal and corneal diseases using different sources of adult and pluripotent stem cells. Pluripotent stem cells are capable of developing into different cell types.Researchers from the LV Prasad Eye Institute for the first time showed that complex 3D corneal organoids can be generated from pluripotent stem cells and mini corneas undergo maturation in test tube (in vitro) and recapitulate steps of normal corneal development.“Availability of such mini corneas at 10 weeks of maturation circumvents the need for complicated cell enrichment protocols and offers a simpler method of establishing enriched cultures of corneal epithelial cell sheets for basic research and for regenerative applications,” Dr Indumathi said in her presentation.The research study said pluripotent stem cells are being explored as alternative stem cell sources to generate cell types of the body. Recent reports demonstrated the possibility of generating complex, three dimensional tissues in test tube.“We generated three-dimensional retinal and corneal organoids from human pluripotent stem cells. Eye field primordial clusters that emerged from differentiating pluripotent stem cells developed into whole eye ball-like, self-organized, three-dimensional, miniature structures consisting of retinal primordia, corneal primordia, primitive eye lid-like outer covering and ciliary margin zone-like adnexal tissues in a step-wise maturation process within 15 weeks. These organoids recapitulate early developmental events in vitro and displayed similar anatomical features and marker expression profiles as that of adult tissues. They offer an alternative tissue source for regenerating different tissues of eye and eliminate the need for complicated cell enrichment procedures,” researchers said.',\n",

Anti-social elements should not be linked with any community”.This tweet raised the hackles of Dalits, as five Dalit families were fasting in protest at not getting possession of residential plots. Against this, Patels from the village also sat on a fast, demanding that the Dalits not be given plots as they belong to the village panchayat. Hardik met the protesting Patidars on January 24, one day after Mevani met the dalits, who were on an indefinite fast.While the land issue has been resolved, with the administration allowing the dalit families to convert their farmland to non-agricultural land to build homes, the tweet has left Dalit community members furious. They even prepared to present a memorandum against Hardik to district collectors in the state, for his ‘offensive comments’.Mevani and Hardik’s friendship peaked ahead of the Gujarat polls, when the Patidar leader congratulated his decision to contest. Mevani also defended Hardik during the sex-tape onslaught and threatened to launch a state-wide stir if the Patidar leader was arrested.Kanu Sumra, a dalit activist who has been active on the land issue, said, “Five Dalit families had gone on an indefinite fast, which lasted around 12 days, in front of the mamlatdar’s office in Detroj. Instead of addressing the issue of the Dalits, Hardik sat with his community members (Patels). The plot, measuring about half a vigha, was promised to Dalits in 2013, when they were forced to leave the neighbouring Bhagapura village. He also called dalits ‘anti-social elements’. When threatened with a protest against him, he apologized for using such words for Dalits.”The issue was finally resolved as the Dalits agreed to convert one vigha of agricultural land into non-agriculture land, with the government promising that it would bear the cost of building the houses,” said Sumra.Jignesh Mevani, he said, “Even if we disagree grossly on more than one issue, for the larger cause against these fascist forces of BJP, we join hands with each other. At the same time, I have all rights have my reservations about him and he also has the right to have disagreement.”Hardik was unavailable for comment despite several attempts.',\n",
       " 'AHMEDABAD: Patidar quota agitation leader, Hardik Patel, met Gujarat governor O P Kohli at Raj Bhavan on Wednesday and said that the BJP-led state government was conspiring to put him behind bars in false cases. He also alleged that the election commission, in connivance with the state government, has started framing him and members of his outfit — PAAS (Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti) in false cases to muzzle their voice.In a memorandum submitted to the governor, Hardik said, “This government is conspiring to send me behind the bars. The ruling party started such preparation because they want a smooth passage in 2019 Lok Sabha polls.”Later, talking to reporters, Hardik said, “The governor has listened to our demands and assured that he would give proper directions to the state government regarding the deteriorating law and order situation of Gujarat. We have also asked the governor to take up the issue with the state home minister.”Attacking the role of the election commission, Hardik said, “Election Commission is working in connivance with the BJP government to book me and my team members under false cases.”He added, “We will meet the chief minister and home minister about the issue. The government must not hold any prejudice against us.”“The most important thing is that the state government was not ready to speak with us on the issue of reservation. Besides, our team was harassed ahead of the polls as we were not granted permission to hold rallies. It seems that the EC had acted in a biased manner against us,” he said.',\n",
       " \"KOLKATA: Real estate developers have welcomed the 1% reduction in stamp duty on property valued up to Rs 1crore that was announced at the state budget on Wednesday. But they feel finance minister Amit Mitra could have provided more relief to home buyers as the latter has to fork out more in GST regime.Credai-Bengal, an umbrella organisation of builders from the state, had in its pre-budget presentation to the finance minister urged the state to reduce the stamp duty in Kolkata and other urban areas from 7% to 5%. Mitra on Wednesday did concede to the demand but only partially, reducing the stamp duty to 6%.Credai-National vice-president Sushil Mohta welcomed the move but admitted he had hoped for a wee bit more. “We had expected the state to do a little more for home buyers. After all, the state exchequer will bag half the GST of 12% levied on the sector,” he reasoned.For a home that costs Rs 50 lakh, a buyer had to earlier pay Rs 3.5 lakh in stamp duty. Henceforth, the payout will be Rs 3 lakh, a saving of Rs 50,000. For homes that cost Rs 1 crore, the payout will be down from Rs 7 lakh to Rs 6 lakh, a saving of Rs 1lakh.However, when compared to the pre-GST regime, the buyer ends up paying more even if 4%-5% benefit by way of input credit is factored in. Prior to GST rollout, a home buyer had to pay 4.5% service tax, 7% stamp duty and 1.1% registration fee. Hence, the total incidence of tax and charges was 12.6%.Following GST rollout, home buyers had to pay 12% GST, 7% stamp duty and 1.1% registration fee that added up to 20.1%. Now, with Mitra announcing 1% reduction in stamp duty, the payout will be 19.1%.“Reducing the stamp duty by 2-3% would have neutralised the impact on buyers,” said Mohta, adding that the stamp duty levied by most states was 5%.Credai-Bengal president Nandu Belani is optimistic. “Hopefully, this is only the beginning and will lead to further rationalisation of stamp duty. Any reduction is welcome. It is a step in the positive direction,” he said.The issue that remains a concern is the high valuation of land in pockets of Kolkata and peripheral areas by the inspector general of registration (IGR). Both stamp duty and income tax is calculated on the basis of the IGR value and not actual payout.For instance, near Uluberia on NH6, cost of land is Rs 1.5 lakh a cottah but the IGR valuation is Rs 6 lakh a cottah. Similarly in Amtala, the IGR valuation is Rs 2 lakh a cottah when land can be purchased at Rs 50,000 a cottah. In Salt Lake Sector V, land is available at Rs 20-25 lakh a cottah but the IGR valuation remains at Rs 50 lakh a cottah. In Rajarhat, too, there is a 30-40% difference between the market price and IGR valuation.Developers aren't clear if the Banglar Bari scheme proposed in the budget is to do with slum redevelopment but if it does, they are eager to be a part of the project. The sketchy announcement made in the budget talks of development of 20,000 flats initially in multistoried buildings for urban poor on a cluster and not individual basis.\",\n",
       " 'KOLKATA: Finance minister Amit Mitra on Wednesday set aside a fair share to infrastructure — a major portion of it in the transport sector — in and around the city. As part of a comprehensive package, funds have been allocated to a number of flyovers, underpasses and expansion of high-speed corridors.The city will have three flyovers, including the one from Ganesh Avenue with two arms — one towards New Market and other towards MG Road crossing — and another one at Manicktala. But the longest flyover will be from Taratala to Jadavpur police station via Tollygunge Phanri and Anwar Shah Road. Moreover, there will be vehicular underpasses at Chiria More, Sinthi More and Tobin Road.Apart from strengthening the infrastructure, the budget has sanctioned funds to make commuting in the city easier. The state has already bought 411 buses for its five state transport undertakings (STUs). And now, it will procure 40 more electric buses. This will, to some extent, set right the skewed government-private bus ratio.An integrated traffic management and surveillance system is being rolled out for smoother and seamless movement of passengers from bus and tram termini to Metro stations, and also to vessels. This year, the transport department is going to integrate all major modes through common prepaid transport card modelled on the Oyster card of London.Riverine transportation along National Waterway-I is going to be the one of biggest highlight of this year’s budget with state’s ambitious Rs 1,021-crore riverine transportation augmentation proposal. The state government had forwarded the project proposal to the World Bank seeking a loan worth Rs 714.7 crore. The state will fund the balance Rs 306.3 crore.Ever since the stretch between Haldia and Allahabad has been declared a national waterway by the Centre, the Bengal government has been playing an active role for greater and systematic movement of goods as well as passengers along the river.',\n",

A three-foot high sculpture of Mahavira, the 24th and last Thirthankara of Jainism, was lying neglected in a vacant land surrounded by bushes in Thakkolam, six km from Arakkonam. Scholar K Ajithadass, who accompanied the 49th Ahimsa Walk, said it belongs to 13th century AD.A three-foot sculpture of Mahavira, found in Arumpakkam faces ruins. Another two, one on seated posture, were in bad shape.The three umbrellas over the head of Mahavira found in Thakkolam have been destroyed. \"But this one is impotent mainly due to the stylistic patterns. This presence of found sculptures of Mahavira shows that the place was once a strong centre of Jainism,\" said Ajithadoss. The walk is conducted with the participation of villagers, scholars and students to create awareness about the importance of TN Jain heritage monuments.The sculpture found outside a temple in Nemili, 7 km from Arakkonam, is not damaged. \"It is properly kept and a pooja is performed every day. We saw marks of sandal paste on the forehead and other parts of the Thirthankara image,\" he said.Apparently, the face of the Mahavira found on a vacant land in Uppukkulam has been damaged due to vandalism. Even though the facial features are not sharp, the accompanying images of three umbrellas, throne, whisk bearers were present.\"We have informed the archology department.

We are confident that our satellite data providers will engage with the Indian authorities to establish regulatory clarity for licensing and operations, to meet necessary requirements, thereby allowing our customers to connect using Wi-Fi and mobile phones over India very soon.\"About voice calls, the Emirates website says: \"Make calls on your mobile just as you would when you\\'re on the ground. To make calls or use data on your mobile, your mobile phone or global roaming provider must have a roaming agreement with our service providers. You\\'ll be charged by your service provider in line with international roaming rates.\" This is for countries that allow use of mobile phones in air, a list that India joined on January 19.Earlier Lufthansa had also said it will offer WiFi on its India flight \"the moment it is allowed to\" but not enable mobile services as the same are seen as too much of a nuisance for fellow travellers. Another leading international airline that already has WiFi and phones on its planes says it does not encourage voice calls during flights.\"Downloading a video and playing it loud or making VOIP calls is something that we do not encourage. Our crew tells such passengers to be mindful of not disturbing fellow passengers. Our aircraft have long had seat-back phones but they are not used much due to their high costs. Similarly VOIP calls, though possible by connecting personal electronic devices to WiFi, are also not much used as this requires huge consumption of expensive data,\" an official of this airline said.Emirates offers 20 MB of free data to all passengers.

Air India is planning to start thrice-weekly nonstops between these cities by mid-March. So far, the only direct link between the two countries is by Israeli carrier El Al which operates on Mumbai-Tel Aviv route.\"We are awaiting confirmation of slots from Delhi and Tel Aviv airports and are finalising our crew for this flight. The three days of operations will be Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday. As soon as the airports confirm the slots to us, we will finalise the flight in a day or two,\" said a senior AI official.The soon-to-be-privatised AI was earlier planning to fly between Mumbai and Tel Aviv, but finally chose the Delhi-Israel route.Israel is not recognised by a majority of the Islamic and Gulf countries that lie between it and India. So El Al\\'s flights between Mumbai and Tel Aviv flights do not overfly some countries on the direct flight path like Saudi Arabia, UAE, Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan.The El Al flight taking off from Tel Aviv for Mumbai has to go to the southern tip of the country, fly over Red Sea, completely avoiding Saudi Arabia and then turn east from the \"horn of Africa\" that juts into the Arabian Sea straight to its destination. As a result, the distance of 4,057 km between Mumbai and Tel Aviv is covered in eight hours – almost the time taken to fly the 6,700-km-apart Delhi and London — instead of the about five hours it would take on the straight route.It remains to be seen if Saudi Arabia allows AI flights to and from Tel Aviv to fly over its airspace. Prime Minister Modi also took the longer route when he flew to Israel last year.AI many years ago used to operate the Airbus A-310 to Israel but had discontinued the route which could now restart later this year.',\n",

They demanded that compensation be increased from Rs20 lakh to Rs50 lakh for Chandan’s family.“The intelligentsia will not speak but the truth is that there is a sinister plot to disturb the atmosphere in the country and silence Hindu voices. ‘Vipatti jab chhoti ho use kuchal dena hitkari hota hai (When the problem is small, it is necessary to finish it there),” the memorandum stated.In 2015, Mohammad Akhlaq Saifi was killed by a mob in Dadri near Delhi on the suspicion that he carried and ate beef. The then SP government had first announced a compensation of Rs20 lakh to Akhlaq’s family, but later increased it to Rs30 lakh.Memorandum drew flak from AzamAkhlaq’s three brothers were given Rs5 lakh each.Also, four two-bedroom apartments in Noida, not covered under any government scheme, were also given to Akhlaq family under the chief minister’s discretionary fund.“Previous governments honoured cow-butcher Akhlaq as a martyr. By that standard, Chandan Gupta was a patriotic servant of the country. It is necessary that Chandan Gupta’s death must get him martyrdom. His familyshould be provided full-time security as well as government job,” the memorandum said.“The compensation amount to the bereaved family should be increased from Rs20 lakh to Rs50 lakh,” said the memorandum.The memorandum drew flak from Samajwadi Party leader and former minister Azam Khan.“Sangh Parivar outfits are provocative. People from both communities will suffer. Since the issue is now always about Muslims or sloganeering involving Pakistan, my appeal is either send all of us to China or take away our voting rights,” Khan told TOI over the phone.',\n",
       " 'KOLKATA: ‘Courage is not the absence of fear, but rather the judgment that something else is more important than fear’. This is one of the driving principles of The Times of India’s ‘Outsmart Cancer’ campaign, launched in association with Apollo Cancer Centre.An initiative to get screened for the disease is indeed the first step to beat cancer, pointed out experts at a series of lectures and panel discussions held at the Saturday Club on January 28. Early detection and a healthy lifestyle, it was pointed out, could prevent 30% of cancer deaths.Delivering the keynote address at the event, Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai director Anil D’Cruz pointed out that a vast majority of patients in India seek treatment at the final stages of the disease when chances of survival have already dipped. “While regular screening is rare, even the early signs of cancer are ignored. This results in late detection, usually in stages three and four when the damage has been done,” said D’Cruz. He added that while lung, breast and ovarian cancer were on the rise, cervical, penile and stomach cancer cases were on the decline. “While 40% of cancers are tobaccorelated, just 20% are caused by infections. This invariably leads us to the question if tobacco should be banned. But prohibition doesn’t always work, as has been proved in the case of Bhutan which became the first country to ban tobacco. Ten years after the ban, a survey revealed that 24.8% of the population still used tobacco,” said D’Cruz.Along with screening, access to treatment, use of the right technology and a right lifestyle were just as important to check cancer mortality, felt Vikram Mathews, associate director of CMC, Vellore. “These are issues which need to be addressed as urgently as regular screening for cancer,” he said. The last 30 years have seen a paradigm shift in cancer treatment, according to Arundhuti Chakraborty, head of radiation oncology at Apollo Gleneagles Cancer Hospital. Speaking at a panel discussion on changing paradigms in medical oncology, she observed that while earlier just four to six drugs were used, now there’s a much wider choice. “In fact, chemotherapy is now on the way out and immunotherapy is taking over,” said Shantanu Acharya, consultant, radiation, oncology at Apollo Gleneagles Cancer Hospital. But the cost of the new treatment remains a challenge,” he added.Chemotherapy in combination with personalized care was the way ahead, felt T Raja, senior consultant, Apollo Cancer Hospitals, Chennai. “Methods like tissue-based assay, single gene mutation analysis, circulating tumour DNA and next generation sequencing are now going to be used more and more,” said Raja.At another panel discussion on ‘Lifestyle and Cancer’, speakers stressed on the need to curb the urge of ‘living life king-size’. “Tobacco, obesity, lack of fruits and vegetables in our daily diet were the most common reasons behind cancer in urban areas. Lifestyles have changed and so have our habits. But many of these are driving us towards cancer,” said Amit Dutt Dwary, senior consultant, Apollo Gleneagles Cancer Hospital.While experts agreed on the importance of early screening, it must fulfil several criteria, pointed out Raja. “It must be simple and lowcost, safe and non-invasive, acceptable to a majority and have a good outcome possibility. The idea is to convince people to go for screenings and unless it is hassle-free and effective, the purpose will be lost,” said Raja.',\n",

       " 'KOLKATA: Save for allocations for the existing Metro projects in Kolkata and the suburbs, Bengal may not get much from the Railway Budget to be tabled in Parliament on Thursday.Plagued by land acquisition problems several railway projects, including Metro expansion plans, are running behind schedule and are facing cost overruns. The Centre isn’t happy with the pace of several Metro projects, including East-West Metro corridor, but is unlikely to starve these for funds.According to a Railway Board official, removal of encroachments from railway land is turning out to be a major problem. “This is happening along the existing Metro stretch where efforts are on to extend the corridor to Dakshineswar and the Kolkata airport. All projects are facing cost and time overruns due to problems with acquisition of land. Despite efforts by the state government, it has still not been possible to acquire sufficient land for a car shed for the Joka-BBD Bag metro link,” the official said.Interestingly, most of the Metro projects were announced by Mamata Banerjee when she was railway minister and they started from 2010-11. According to another official, links like Joka-BBD Bag and connectivity to Dakshineswar and the airport should have been completed by now.However, the state and the Ministry of Railways over the past few months have weeded out the problems. The Centre is unlikely to put a fund spanner, sources said, as these projects are nearing completion now.Some other projects in the state may even get shelved and sent to the ‘Rs 1,000 allocation bracket’ due to lack of physical progress.“When the Ministry of Railways is no longer interested in a project but doesn’t want to shut it down officially, only a token allotment of Rs 1,000 is made annually for it in the budget. There are apprehensions that some projects may get shelved. So far as new ones are concerned, there seems little possibility. The ongoing metro projects are likely to get proper allocations,” a railway official said.Among the projects that the railways is no longer interested in is the link between Bargachhia and Champadanga. The state was paid Rs 23 crore to acquire land for the project but it failed to do so. The link between Arambagh and Bowaichandi may also get shelved due to this hurdle. Work on the 18.80 km Deshpran–Nandigram link has also stopped after people moved court over land acquisition. The connectivity between Dankuni and Furfura Sharif is also caught in similar trouble.However, the railways will not close down commercially unviable lines where services operate. The railways had recently carried out an exercise to seek 50% participation of states towards the costs involved in operations. Under Eastern Railway, the lines identified were Sonarpur-Canning, Santipur-Nabadwipghat, Barasat-Hasnabad, Kalyani-Kalyani Simanta, Ballygunge-Budge Budge, Baruipur-Namkhana, Burdwan-Katwa and Bhimghar-Palasthali.',\n",
       " 'GREATER NOIDA: Vehicles of the Gautam Budh Nagar district magistrate and other senior officials are still sporting crash guards despite the Centre issuing a directive that the accessories be removed as they pose safety hazards.Following the Centre’s decision to ban crash guards in December last year, the Uttar Pradesh had issued a notice earlier this month saying vehicles sporting the metal bars would be fined Rs 1,000 for the first offence and Rs 2,000 for every second violation.Most of the administrative officials told this correspondent they had heard about the new rule and would soon remove the crash guards. The guards are fixed to the front of a vehicle to protect it from damage. But the government has said the accessories render a vehicle’s in-built safety features useless.When TOI visited the collectorate office, it found crash guards installed on the official vehicles of the DM, district supply officer, district treasury officer and the joint commissioner, sales tax.Many officials said they had heard about the new directive banning the guards but were ignorant about the implementation.The official Innova of district magistrate BN Singh (UP32BG6860) has a crash guard on the rear while district supply officer RN Yadav’s Bolero (UP16G0663) has it in the front. The Bolero used by district treasury officer Ashok Kumar sports a bull bar in the front and the Sumo Gold (UP16G0830) of joint commissioner, sales tax, Dharamveer Singh has installed the accessory at the back.“The news (of banning crash guards) has been doing the rounds and the DM’s war room (a WhatsApp group for circulation of information about administrative activities) has been sending messages about it. We will have to remove it,” RN Yadav said.Treasury officer Ashok Kumar said he had not been using the car sporting the metal bar of late. “It might be parked on the office premises but it is not being used. The bull bars will be removed soon,” he said.Dharamveer Singh said he had installed only a bike guard to protect the vehicle from motorcycles. “It will be removed in a day or two,” he said.Private vehicles, however, seem to be at the receiving end of the administration. The transport department on Monday fined three vehicles sporting crash guards when they came to seek fresh fitness certificates.Arunendra Pandey, ARTO (administration), said they had received a letter from the transport commissioner about the new guidelines and would soon send a missive to the officials.Pandey, however, said the officials should have taken off the guards by now.SP (traffic) Anil Jha declined comment when asked if his department had received any directive to fine government vehicles.In addition to imposing fines, the UP transport commissioner had asked all regional transport officers to convene a meeting of traders dealing in crash guards and discourage them from selling the accessories. The meeting is yet to be held.While banning the guards, the Centre had quoted the Motor Vehicles Act of 1988 that doesn’t allow any alteration to vehicles.',\n",
       " 'GANDHINAGAR: Pravin Togadia, the international working president of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), has sent a reconciliatory message to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, urging him to patch up their differences in the interests of the nation and Hindutva. The Gujarat government recently withdrew a two-decade-old attempt-to-murder case against Togadia, for which he thanked Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani, deputy chief minister Nitin Patel, and minister of state for home Pradipsinh Jadeja. When Modi was an RSS pracharak decades ago in Gujarat, Togadia was close to him. The relations between the two soured when Modi became Gujarat’s chief minister in 2001. On January 16 this year, a day after he went missing despite his Z-category security cover, Togadia had resurfaced to allege that he had been tipped off about a plan to kill him in a police encounter.But now, Togadia has sent out his placatory message to Modi while talking TOI. “Narendrabhai, let us come together. Let us work for the nation,” Togadia said. “Unemployment of youth, the poor economic condition of farmers, the deteriorating condition of small-scale industries, and the health of the nation — these are matters of concern.” Every year, around 1 crore families become poor because of unexpected medical costs, Togadia said. “We have made some promises to the people of India,” he said. “These include tackling the rising cost of education, introducing a law in the parliament that will facilitate the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya, introducing a law to protect cows, and rehabilitating Hindus in the Kashmir valley.”Togadia said a rapprochement was necessary to fulfil those promises. “Let us sit together to resolve our differences,” Togadia said in his message to Modi. “You sit with Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan and the maulvis of India. So we can come together too, to work for the betterment of the nation. I am an old friend. We have had meals together.” Togadia also cautioned Modi “to not break the ladder which helped him on his ascent.” Such an act would be contrary to Indian culture, Togadia said.Addressing Modi as mota bhai (elder brother) Togadia said: “I hope that mota bhai looks down from the sky to the ground and has a dialogue with old friends like us. We are connected with lakhs of workers on the ground.” Modi is older and was Togadia’s senior in the RSS ranks. “Mota bhai speaks to the leaders of foreign countries; he should spare some time for us too,” Togadia said.',\n",

The actual buying takes place online — on the webpages of five city stores.Though big publishers were initially apprehensive about tying up with e-stores, they now agree that the digital platforms have made sizeable additions to their sales. The firms now extend huge discounts — at times as much as 40% — to these online stores, which they then pass on to buyers. This year, some online stores have set up stalls on the book fair grounds, not only to spread awareness about themselves, but also to report the book fair live for buyers unable to visit.Boichoi.com and Aranyamon.com are two of these e-stores. “If you visit our website you will be amazed at the number of hits, interactions and orders that are pouring in now that the book fair is on. We are constantly giving updates on new books on the stacks, encouraging buyers to place orders, posting pictures and inviting people to take a virtual tour of the fair with us. There is a huge response,” said Chiranjit Das of Aranyamon.com.Online sales comprise at least 25% of the total Bengali books sold by publishers. There is a sizeable rise in these figures during the book fair and the trend continues over Poila Boishakh and the pujas. Even during a lean period, online Bengali bookstores make anything between Rs 1.5 lakh to Rs 3 lakh, say proprietors.“On an average, we sell at least 3,000 volumes a month and during a brisk period we sell as many as 5,000 books. At this moment we are dealing with a stock of 25,000 Bengali titles,” explained Pritam Sengupta, the proprietor of the three-year-old readbengalibooks.com. There are several offers too, like autographed copies of the recently released autobiography of Prosenjit Chatterjee that are only available on this website. The store also has free delivery on a minimum charge of Rs 300.Delivery, however, is a big issue for these stores. “On an average, a Bengali book costs Rs 175 and its weight is anywhere between 30gm and 40gm. To absorb delivery costs, I have now started my own courier service,” said Avik Sarkar, of boichoi.com.Ishita Chakraborty, a young blogger, has been buying books online for the past two years. “I buy both English and Bengali books online, simply because of the additional discounts and the convenience of receiving books at home,” she said.“Digital sales of books have added wind to our sail.

Consul general of Norway, Ann Ollestad, who was in Ahmedabad on Wednesday said, Norway will soon explore business collaborations for electrification of ports in Gujarat using renewable energy sources. Ollestad was present at a business meeting organized at Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industries (GCCI).To take this forward, a high-level business delegation from Norway will visit Ahmedabad at the end of April this year. Sharing more details, Ollestad said, “This will be achieved by deploying clean energy sources at ports. Gujarat is also developing its ports and the same could help minimize seawater pollution. We’ve implemented this across ports in Norway, too, and have been using green shipping technologies widely.”The business delegation that is set to visit from Norway will also explore business opportunities in sectors such as waste recycling including biofuel and clean water technologies in addition to ship breaking technologies and research opportunities in pharmaceuticals.“Norway has widely implemented zero-waste technology and the same could be a major boost to Gujarat and India. There is a wide scope for collaboration when it comes to environment-friendly practices and technologies,” said Shailesh Patwari, president, GCCI.Ollestad said Norway is also looking to collaborate with educational institutes for higher education. “We would approach institutes like IIMA and IIT Bombay. We are looking at collaboration between universities in Norway and leading institutes in India over higher education at masters level programmes,” he said. “As part of the exchange, students will not just study in another country, but also take training at companies in the respective countries they’re visiting to get better work exposure and understand the business cultures of the two countries better,” she said.',\n",

The decision came a week after the long-awaited multi-level parking facility was opened to the public.Only 1,340 vehicles will be allowed to park at 50 designated spots in the commercial complex, while the rest will have to park within the eight-floor parking facility. Anyone parking at spots other than those earmarked will be fined Rs 1,000 and their vehicles will be towed away, Authority officials said.According to officials, the management and operations of the multi-level parking facility, as well as parking in the entire sector, will be handled by DLF Ltd from February 1. “We have reserved about 18,000sqm of space for parking along the surface area of Sector 18,” said SC Mishra, Noida Authority project engineer and work circle incharge of the area. “We have designated particular areas for parking of 1,060 four-wheelers and 280 two-wheelers in the area. The parking facility can park an additional 3,000 vehicles, including 2,280 four-wheelers and 180 two-wheelers,” he said.“If vehicles are parked anywhere other than at these spots, they will be towed away. Also, a fine of Rs 1,000 will be levied on four-wheelers and Rs 500 on two-wheelers. We will not allow double parking or parking at crossroads. Display boards will be installed to inform vehicle owners about the designated parking spots,” Mishra added.In an attempt to deter motorists from parking in the congested market area, Noida Authority has also set the parking at Rs 20 and Rs 10 per hour for four and two-wheelers, respectively.Within the multi-level parking complex, four-wheelers will be charged Rs 30 for the first two hours and thereafter Rs 10 every hour. Two-wheelers will have to pay Rs 10 for first two hours and Rs 5 per subsequent hour.“The safety and security of vehicles will be the responsibility of the contractor.

I was directed to take the road under it. As I took the Park Circus connector, I realized that it was shut too. I was stuck for over 20 minutes before I was able to take a U-turn and move till Beliaghata crossing to take the Beliaghata Main Road. It took me almost an hour to reach Sealdah from EM Bypass.”Twenty tableaus participated in the procession celebrating the birth anniversary of Guru Ravidass — a 14th century saint and reformer of the Bhakti movement in North India. The rally started from Ravidas Sarani near Park Cicrus 7- point crossing around 1pm and lasted six hours. It left traffic in east, central, north and parts of south Kolkata crippled. The rally moved through Park Circus, Park Street, Moulali, Sealdah, Rajabazar, Amherst Street, Wellington and Esplanade.“We were informed in advance about the rally, but the sheer number of participants were too much to handle. We tried our best to set in diversions and maintain traffic. However, traffic on routes that the procession followed, went out of gear,” a senior Kolkata Traffic Police officer said.

We are not even counting the smaller industries in textile so far. Our focus so far is to promote garmenting, technical textiles, yarn spinning and to promote meetings between buyers and sellers. We have already received a proposal for setting up a textile park along the Yamuna Expressway at an investment of Rs 5,000 crore,” said Singhal.He said that specific interest has been expressed in investing around Varanasi, Gorakhpur and Lucknow.

The operator’s reply was not satisfactory following which a complaint was filed under sections 4 and 10 of Uttar Pradesh Protection of Trees in Rural and Hill Areas Act, 1976.The forest department had sent a range officer who initially filed a fake report claiming that there was no pruning. However, further investigations revealed that there was pruning and the official was suspended. The second inspection found that some 46 trees along the stretch were illegally pruned to improve hoardings’ visibility.Divisional forest officer H V Girish said the department had received a complaint from environmental activist Vikrant Tongad. The forest department sent a team headed by Dadri range officer D K Goyal for spot inspection. However, Goyal filed a report in November 2017, saying he conducted an inspection and found there was no pruning of trees.“We have told residents in the neighbouring residential societies to get prior permission from the forest department in case of pruning of trees, as per the law,” Goyal’s report said. The forest department forwarded this report to the UP government.However, Tongad said he was not satisfied with Goyal’s report as there is no residential society along the DND Flyway. “I filed another complaint against this report. The official had filed its report without personal inspection of the spot,” Tongad said. The forest department initiated an inquiry which revealed that there was actually pruning of some trees and Goyal had filed a false report. Goyal was later suspended.The department sent another team headed by beat officer Nidhi Bharadwaj to conduct a fresh inspection. On January 12, the inspection team found that the DND Flyway operator had illegally trimmed several trees to adjust visibility of the hoardings at several locations.“The inspection team found a total of 46 trees – Neem, Peepal, Pilkhan, Arjun – were trimmed.

The four most widely subscribed channels were Star Jalsha, Star Jalsha Movies, Star Plus and Star Sports, but their numbers were not significant enough to revert to a fixed-fee agreement with the broadcaster that was called off a month ago.Star channels were beamed into 12 lakh SitiCable subscriber homes in Kolkata as part of packages till December 31. “Since we started offering them a la carte, 74% have opted for Star Jalsha, which is by far the most popular Star channel. But just 45% have chosen Star Jalsha Movies and 14% have opted for Star Plus. A mere 5% have opted for the Star Sports channels. This shows that the numbers are not big enough for the channels to be included in packages. We will continue to offer the channels a la carte,” said Suresh Sethia of SitiCable. Star India did not respond to TOI’s calls.Less than 1% of SitiCable subscribers, according to Sethia, have opted for the other Star channels. “It makes no sense to burden subscribers with all 64 Star channels which don’t have a large enough viewership. Barring Star Jalsha, the rest have alimited following in this part of the country.

As per his defence story, the second woman went “mad” with anger when she found him sleeping with Dookhran. He claimed he later found the woman upstairs in the bathroom holding a knife and blood on her hand.According to the prosecution, 33-year-old Arshid and a labourer named Vincent Tappu, 28, kidnapped Dookhran and the second woman and took them to an empty property in Kingston where Arshid raped both, murdered Dookhran and tried to kill the other.Looking confident and relaxed in a light grey suit, Arshid admitted causing injuries to the second woman but said he did not intend to kill her. “When you are fighting for your life you do whatever you have to do. Unless you are in that situation where you have got someone who is trying to kill you, you can’t say,” he told the jury.Arshid also admitted owning a taser.

The civic body’s newly formed finance and contract committee (F&CC) will take a look at it and then it will be tabled in to the MC house for an approval before being sent to the UT administration, which will decide on the final amount to be fixed for the MC.Of the Rs 910.46 crore, the accounts department of the civic body has kept rupees 256.95 crore under the ‘capital’ segment and Rs 653.51 crores have been earmarked for the ‘revenue’ section. Like previous years, this time too the engineering department of the MC has been allocated a large share of the amount (nearly 20%) in the capital segment. The department, which has three crucial wings under it (building and roads, public health, and horticulture), has been allocated Rs 100 crore.Compared to the previous two years, the civic body has sought less money than before as it had been earlier criticised for exaggerating the money it needed. “In last two consecutive financial years, the civic body passed and proposed a budget of over Rs 1,000 crore. Due to this, we had been constantly coming under criticism, with many saying that we wre preparing exaggerated figures and were not realistic. Therefore, this time, we went into the details and tried to prepare a realistic budget,” said an official of the MC.Apart from budgetary figures, the authority has also prepared other financial details regarding the civic body’s income from its sources, the status of its fixed deposits, and its present financial condition.',\n",

Police have, in their 235-page chargesheet, also recommended that Kaur be tried under Section 75 of the Juvenile Justice (JJ) Act. The harshest charge in the chargesheet, attempt to commit culpable homicide (Section 308 of the Indian Penal Code), was added on directions of the court.If she is found guilty of voluntarily causing hurt, Kaur could face up to a year in jail. The prison term, if she is convicted of attempt to commit culpable homicide, could be up to three years. The Times of India had reported Kaur’s alleged assault, after it received a video of her in the act and contacted the family of the girl. The video was made by the victim’s elder brother. She was booked on December 3 and arrested from a relative’s house in Sector 27 on December 7.Twenty-five witnesses have been named in the chargesheet. They include head constable Yashpal, sub-inspectors Kulwinder Singh and Parmod Kumar, Child Welfare Comittee chairperson Sangita Vardhan, and Rajnit Kaur of GMCH, Sector 32. The next hearing of the case is on February 1.As per the chargesheet, the couple was living at Sector 29, when Kaur’s “cruelty” was recorded on a cellphone. In the video clip, Kaur is seen assaulting the girl after putting her in a jute bag and banging her on the floor repeatedly.The FIR against Kaur was registered after taking legal opinion. The injured stepdaughter also narrated her ordeal to a child helpline counsellor. The father had then approached the Child Welfare Committee, Sector 19. The Chandigarh Commission for Protection of Child Rights (CCPCR) too had summoned the stepmother, her husband, and the SHO concerned.Manmohan Singh, the girl’s father, had earlier claimed that his son made the video clip and handed it to him. He was taken aback to see the cruelty of his second wife towards his daughter from his first wife. His first wife passed away two-and-a-half years ago and Manmohan married Kaur in 2016. He had filed a police complaint, seeking action against Kaur. While Singh has two children from his first wife, Kaur, a divorcee prior to marrying Singh, has a daughter from her first marriage.',\n",
       " \"HYDERABAD: Over half of the women in the state (51%) and a little less than half of the men in the state (46%) are malnourished (either too thin or are overweight to obese) despite a reduction in under-nutrition over the last decade.In fact, the state has seen a huge jump in over-nutrition, which is aggravating the malnutrition problem. This problem of malnourishment has been underlined in the National Family and Health Survey (NFHS-4), India's biggest survey of social indicators that was released recently.Compared to the previous survey carried out in 2005, obesity in Telangana women has gone up by over 10%, which is a worrying trend, indicated experts. In fact, more men and women were found to be overweight or obese than thin, with 28% of women and 24% of men being overweight or obese.“While this increase in obesity in women may be primarily due to a sedentary lifestyle, the jump has been significant. During the last survey, it was around 12-14%. Moreover, even as anaemia and under-nutrition is on the decline, over-nutrition has seen a huge jump. This means that the overall number of people who are malnourished remain the same,” explained Dr Avala Laxmaiah, director grade scientist, National Institute of Nutrition (NIN) Hyderabad.Another alarming trend is that 57% of women in Telangana have anaemia, including 37% with mild anaemia, 18% with moderate anaemia, and 3% with severe anaemia.“Anaemia is particularly high for women belonging to scheduled tribes and Christian women, but half or more women are anaemic in every subgroup, except those not belonging to a scheduled caste, scheduled tribe or other backward class,” read the NFHS 4 (2015-2016) report.Surprisingly, boys were found to be more likely to have anaemia than girls but with age the anaemia prevalence decreased. In comparison to 62% boys having anaemia, 59% girls had anaemia. Experts ascribe the high levels of physical activity in smaller boys to the phenomenon but rule gender bias in food being a reason.However, “children whose mothers are anaemic have a much higher prevalence of anaemia (65%-73%) than children whose mothers are not anaemic (54%). Although anaemia levels vary according to most background characteristics, at least half the children in every subgroup are anaemic, except children age 48-59 months. In this oldest age group of children tested for anaemia, 44% are anaemic,” the report said.Meanwhile though undernutrition has gone down by 10% (as compared to the previous survey) 23% women and 21% men in Telangana were reported to be too thin. However to be able to reach the Sustainable Development Goals (SGD) set by the World Health Organization (WHO) the rate at which under-nutrition is reducing must double, indicated experts.\",\n",

Rs 81 crore will be spent on the construction of a flyover along with an underpass at Atul Kataria Chowk and the work will be awarded by May 1. This chowk is a bottleneck and requires a flyover and an underpass to ease snarls,” said chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, who chaired the GMDA meeting.In 2013, the authorities had proposed a flyover on Hero Honda Road at Umang Bhardwaj Chowk. The PWD was supposed to build it while MCG was supposed to share the cost. But last year, the plan was amended to convert the stretch from Hero Honda Chowk to Basai into a six-lane thoroughfare connecting Dwarka Expressway. Huda is supposed to acquire the land while NHAI is supposed to develop the project and MCG is to share the cost.Similarly, the flyover and the underpass at Atul Kataria Chowk were announced way back in July 2015 by the then MCG mayor. The chowk receives a huge volume of vehicles going from old Gurugram to Huda City Centre and other parts of new Gurugram.The chief minister said the government was working on software, ‘One Map Gurugram’, to keep tabs on encroachments, especially on government land. “Every month, mapping will be done to check if there has been any encroachment on public land. We will also have a GMDA meeting once every three months and the second meeting will be held before the end of three months since we need to discuss the budget among other things,” he added.',\n",

He rushed inside and saw Pandey attacking the girl with a knife, while the juvenile was holding her arm. However, the duo fled from the spot after seeing her friend. On the victim’s complaint, police arrested the duo.The prosecution argued in court that the accused should be given maximum punishment as the woman’s had been spoilt by the attack, and the accused had scarred her for life. The defence, on the other hand, argued that the accused did not even know the victim and had been falsely implicated by the police .The court, after hearing the arguments, convicted the accused under Section 307 (attempt to murder) of IPC and sentenced him to five years in jail.',\n",

We are waiting for the individual guards to report on the identified points. Accordingly, new roads might be added to our list,” said an officer. He added that with an exponential rise in the number of appcabs, they were trying to keep the main thoroughfares free of snarls without inconveniencing anyone.So far, 108 points have been selected on 26 thoroughfares, like Central Avenue, Chowringhee, Strand Road, Diamond Harbour Road, CIT Road and AJC Bose Road. Drivers who stop on these major roads at places other than at the 108 designated points, face a Rs 100 fine for the first offence and will have to fork out Rs 300 for every subsequent one; repeat offenders stand the risk of losing their licence.However, there is no bar on picking up or dropping off passengers on roads apart from these 26.TIMES VIEWKeeping options open and having regular reviews are the right approach, especially when some users have expressed apprehensions.',\n",

JAC convener B S Saini said, “Rehabilitation of small-scale industrial tenants has been a pending demand.”The committee took up the issue of leasehold to leasehold transfer and leasehold to freehold transfer of industrial plots. In Industrial Policy 2015, the administration promised the transfer of industrial plots from leasehold to leasehold and leasehold to freehold, but never came good on it.The administration allotted leasehold plots in both phases of industrial area between 1973 and 1982, on a condition that these plots were transferable after 15 years.

There are around 2,500 leasehold plots in the two phases. All plots in Phase II were allotted on leasehold. Till 2011, owners transferred plots by entering into an agreement with buyers on Rs 100 stamp paper.The committee also urged the minister to allow construction of additional floors on non-converted industrial plots.

Anything much beyond that, however, may draw a swift sell-off in the markets.For all India budget stories, see: TAKE A LOOK.Investors were already spooked this week after India\\'s Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramanian, in an economic survey ahead of the budget, suggested \"a pause\" in the fiscal consolidation path, while the government attempts to reinvigorate growth.Indian shares fell for a second consecutive session on Wednesday, as investors opted to book profits ahead of the budget, with markets trading near all-time highs.The benchmark 10-year bond yield closed flat at 7.60 percent on Wednesday, but it is up 13 basis points from its close on Friday after Subramanian\\'s comments.',\n",

The project, estimated to cost Rs 1,101.43 crore, is aimed at reducing water stagnation during monsoon by constructing a network of micro and macro-sized storm drains and connecting it to flood carriers like the Cooum and Adyar rivers. ISWD for the Cooum basin covers the Nandambakkam, Ambattur Sidco, Nolambur and Padikuppam canals.In the initial resettlement action plan (RAP) for Padikuppam canal, 231 project-affected families (PAFs) were identified. PAFs included 158 residences and 73 commercial establishments who had encroached upon the canal.In the revised supplementary RAP, the corporation blamed “political unwillingness” for the change of plans. “Despite the best efforts taken by (the corporation)...most PAFs are refusing to move out,” the report said.To accommodate the encroachments, the corporation decided against its initial proposal to widen the canal’s width from the existing 10m to 22m. The justification offered by the corporation takes into account the canal’s discharge capacity should there be a rainfall of 68mm per hour. “The run off for a maximum rainfall of 68mm/hour is 72.53cusecs. At the existing width, the canal’s carrying capacity is 120cusecs at maximum velocity,” the report noted.The corporation also explained that the additional 12m width was proposed to facilitate movement of vehicles during ISWD construction. “It was observed that materials can be easily carted to the canal site through an adjacent road (and) via the canal as it is dry (except during monsoon),” the report added.However, the corporation failed to take into account that the canal is a major sewarage carrier courtesy of illegal outlets. TOI’s survey of the canal’s bank showed that the waterway has been abused by way of dumping garbage and creating multiple illegal points of sewage entry.

       " 'GURUGRAM: The state government has appointed two members each for the two H-Rera benches in Gurugram and Panchkula, moving a step closer to making the regulatory authority functional.Earlier, the government had named additional chief secretary (education) KK Khandelwal as the head of the Gurugram bench and additional chief secretary (health) Rajan Gutpa as the chief of the Panchkula bench last November.Officials claimed that the two chairpersons and the just appointed members were likely to assume charges in the first week of February.Samir Kumar, a retired IAS officer, and Subhash Chander Kush, a former chief town planner, have been picked for the Gurugram bench.On the other hand, Anil Kumar Panwar, a retired district and sessions judge, and Dilbag Singh Sihag, also a former chief town planner, will serve on the Panchkula bench. Sihag, the man who is credited with the drafting of the H-Rera rules, has been acting as the H-Rera executive director so far.“The appointments will be effective from the dates they assume charges. Their tenure will be of five years or till they attain the age of 65 years, whichever is earlier,” read the notification issued by the department of town and country planning on Monday.The Gurugram bench, according to officials, would start functioning out of a newly constructed guest house of the public works department (PWD) located on the Old Railway Road near the district court from February 5. And, the bench will get its permanent office in Sector 44 in the next six months or so.“Gurugram, which houses around 65% of the state’s realty projects and reports an increasing number of builder-buyer disputes, needs the Rera office at the earliest. So, it is essential that we start the Gurugram bench as soon as possible,” a senior H-Rera official told TOI on Wednesday.An accounts wing, an administrative wing and a legal wing apart, the Gurugram office will have a complaint and registry wing. A total of 52 officials will work there initially but the number will be increased in coming days. The work force will include officials on deputation, retired government servants as well as those hired on a temporary basis.Officials said complaints filed under Rera would be ideally resolved within 60 days. An RTI plea has revealed that nearly 382 projects, most of which are in Gurugram, have been registered under the Rera in Haryana since last July while buyers filed complaints against 67 developers during the same period.In response to the query filed by Gurugram-based activist Aseem Takyar, the authorities have also claimed that 21 developers had been show-caused between May and June (2017) for publishing advertisements on newspapers without registering their projects under the Rera.',\n",
       " 'CHANDIGARH: The UT power department has said it will not be able to cut transmission and distribution (T&D) losses below the limit set by the Joint Electricity Regularity Commission (JERC).The department has suffered losses to the tune of around Rs 50 crore in past four years. It has been at the receiving end of criticism for passing on high T&D losses on to consumers.In a petition filed before the commission, the department said it managed to bring down T&D losses from 16% in 2013-14 to 14% in 2016-17. However, it will be difficult to substantially bring losses down from this level. The commission has set a 13.25% limit on T&D losses for Chandigarh.The department has cited non-availability of inter-state transmission point within boundaries of Chandigarh for high T&D losses. The metering is done at 400 KV Nalagarh, 220 KV Mohali and 220 KV Dhulekote. The losses at 66KV and 33 KV stage are known as sub-transmission losses, while those at 11 KV and below are termed as distribution losses. T&D losses are difference between energy purchased by the licensee and energy billed to consumers. For efficient functioning of the system, it must be ensured that there are minimum losses in sub-transmission and distribution.The losses occur mainly on two counts — technical and commercial. Technical losses occur due to inherent character of equipment used for transmitting and distributing power, while commercial losses occur due to theft of energy, defective meters and drawl of unmetered supply.The electricity department caters to 2.28 lakh consumers divided into nine different categories. As per the official figures, of total consumers 1.99 lakh are domestic, which accounts to more than 87% of total consumers. Remaining 23 % belongs to other categories namely commercial, small power, medium supply, large supply, bulk supply, public lighting, agriculture power and temporary supply.‘TOUGH ASK’In a petition before Joint Electricity Regularity Commission, UT power department said it brought down T&D losses from 16% in 2013-14 to 14% in 2016-17It said it will be difficult for it to bring down T&D losses under the 13.25% limit set by the commissionIt cited non-availability of transmission points within boundaries of Chandigarh for the high losses',\n",

       " 'HYDERABAD: The low calorie diet (just 600-800 calories per day) and the Ketogenic diet (extremely low carbs) are the latest diet fads gaining ground in the city thanks to their effectiveness in reversing Type-2 diabetes.In fact, these diets are increasingly being recommended by diabetologists and dieticians for weight management and related issues, including ‘remission of diabetes’.Lowering sugar levels through low calorie diet is clearly a benefit for diabetics. “Lower need for insulin is also useful as lowering insulin levels can reduce insulin resistance, which can help reverse Type-2 diabetes. Insulin is also the fat storage hormone so reducing its level with a low-carb diet can help with weight loss,” explains Dr Rahul Agarwal, senior consultant diabetologist, Max-Cure Hospitals, Madhapur.One of the latest studies published in ‘The Lancet’ shows that by replacing the diet (to around 850 kcal per day) almost half the participants achieved remission to a non-diabetic state and were off antidiabetic drugs.“While studies have proven that in case of low calorie diet the remission of diabetes was linked to weight lost, ketogenic diet has been proven in recent studies to even reduce the HbA1c levels (which is the diabetes readings for a three month period). While the diet was followed for 6-8 weeks and up to a year in different studies, diabetes remission happened in 50-70% of patients,” explained Dr P Janaki Srinath, consultant nutritionist and national executive member Indian Dietetic Association.However, experts caution against taking up these diets without expert supervision as it can be highly risky and lead to an imbalance of vitamins and minerals.They point out that while diets under supervision can last from six weeks to a couple of months, people tend to go overboard when taken up without any guidance, upsetting the body’s nutrient balance.Apart from the period when the diet is followed, even the period of transition to regular diet needs to be monitored as that’s when more harm can happen, add experts.',\n",

Action may be taken by DGP of states/UTs,” says a note sent by Union ministry of home affairs (MHA) to police chiefs and home departments of states.Uttar Pradesh, Kerala and Assam are among the few states from which MHA has sought this assistance.Instead of taking radicalised youth through a long criminal trial, Singapore model is based on lessons in nationalism and religious rehabilitation with the help of popular scholars and community leaders.The Centre’s proposal further states that there is a need for “involvement of a dedicated ministry for dissemination of effective counter narratives.”“There is a need to develop a standard operative procedure (SOP) to deal with radical material and websites along with three-pronged counselling system involving the family, clergy and professionals,” it says.“The effort is to get back the Indian youth who have got drawn towards organisations like Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) in the recent past due to various reasons,” said a senior UP government official.“There is a need for eminent Muslim religious leaders to come forward with credible counter narratives and alternate narratives,” it adds.Even as several hundred Malaysians and Indonesians in the neighbourhood have gone to join Islamic State or similar groups in Syria, the Singapore government over the years has tapped unpaid volunteer group of moderate academicians and teachers who offer religious counselling to detained extremists and their families.‘Bring together reformed elements, victims of terror’The Centre is also learnt to have sought assistance from states to bring together “reformed elements” and “victims of terrorism” in the programme to remove radicalism.The Centre has also advised the states that a close watch must be maintained on foreign donations of Wahahabi-Salafi doctrinated-outfits.The same proposal also seeks the cooperation of states to help contribute to a cell in the ministry of home affairs that will deal with “anti-national propaganda.” The government intends to start its own websites to differentiate between 'fact and myth” while saying there have been instances when inflammatory shared posts on Whatsapp, Facebook and Twitter have triggered untoward incidents in parts of India “Rumour mongering on social media could also be effectively countered by creating fact or myth websites.” Government sources said that it has appointed Intelligence Bureau (IB) to conceive the SOP and discuss with states.\",\n",

This brings the total number of gharials released on the Beas to 25, six decades after the species went extinct on the river.The release spot is more than 75 km from the Harike barrage. The third phase of release will be conducted after February 10, and will comprise the 15 gharials, which have been bred in captivity at Chhatbir zoo. “We will release the final batch for the season in the next 10-15 days and make it 40 gharials in all. We will resume release of the next batches in the winter of 2018-2019. All the 15 gharials took 2.5 hours to finally go into the Beas river on Wednesday after they were freed from specially-designed caskets that brought them from Chhatbir. The 15 gharials stayed around the island, which is an undisturbed area of considerable size, length of more than 300 m and is broken by shallow creeks running inside,” Punjab PCCF (wildlife) Dr Kuldip Kumar told TOI.The first two phases of re-introduction involved 25 gharials brought from the Morena captive breeding centre in Madhya Pradesh. The Punjab government has been promised a 100 gharials for release on the Beas by breeding centres in Kukrail (Uttar Pradesh) and Morena. “The gharials from Morena were first trained to swim against water currents and fed on live fish at the zoo. The health status of gharials was observed by the veterinary wing and were found fit for release. Gharials were scientifically managed at the zoo and transported in dedicated containers to the Beas river. The zoo has actively participated in the first-of-its-kind reintroduction-cum-conservation programme of the Punjab government. After successful reintroduction of 10 gharials on December 25, 2017, at Rakhh-Gagdewal, the forests and wildlife preservation department decided to go for release of gharials at regular intervals until healthy colonies of gharials are established on the Beas river, which was once a flourishing habitat for this species,” Chhatbir field director M Sudhagar told TOI.The gharial has been decimated in the wilderness of the Indian sub-continent and less than 2,000 survive in freedom of which no more than 200 are breeding-sized adults. The Gurdaspur Gazetteer of 1914 mentions the presence of gharial, otter and dolphin in the Beas, Ravi and their flood plains but by the 1960s the gharial was hurtling towards extinction in Punjab. One record of the gharial from Punjab is the hunting trophy that hangs in the Villa Buena Vista of the erstwhile Kapurthala royal, Brig Sukhjit Singh (MVC). This gharial specimen, measuring 15 feet 10 inches from snout to tail tip, was shot on January 13, 1913, by his father, the late Maharaja Jagatjit Singh of Kapurthala, on the Bien rivulet with a single bullet of the .375 Magnum Holland & Holland double-barrel rifle.',\n",

A recent study by a team of doctors from NHL Municipal College at Shardaben Hospital reveals that teens between 15 and 19 years of age are contracting nearly half as many sexually-transmitted diseases prevalent in adults twice their age.Of the 381 teens studied, 200 boys and 181 girls, nearly 77% of boys and 51% of girls said they were sexually active with partners. This should concern teachers and parents.Anita Mehta, a councillor with a school in Satellite says, “The majority of teens are uncomfortable talking to their parents about sex. Such children are very unlikely to ask for help when unusual symptoms appear and they need to be tested or treated for a sexually transmitted infection.”Among teenage girls, nearly 69% (126) had vulvovaginal discharge — which may have resulted from a yeast infection, 9.4% had bacterial vaginosis and 8% had herpes progenitalis. Among the boys, nodular scabies infection was found in 62%, 10.5% had genital molluscum, while 9.5% had herpes progenitalis.The study was conducted by Jigna Barot, Avanita Solanki, Neela Patel, Khushboo Modi, Miral Bodar of the department of dermatology, AMC-MET Medical College, and NHL Medical College. Their study claimed that sexual activity began as early as 10 years among street boys and in the mid and late teens among boys and girls from rural and urban areas. Mehta adds, “This fear of approaching an elder can be dangerous because an untreated infection can have consequences like a pelvic inflammation and can even lead to infertility. Parents should begin engaging with talk on such essential topics in the early teens.”The research team analysed sexually transmitted diseases among teenagers and their sexual behaviour over a prolonged period, from January 2009.From the 2011 census figures, in Gujarat, nearly 1.06 lakh girls and 70,312 boys were married below 15 years of age. In the age group of 15-19 years, there are 3,97,211 girls who are married, while another 2,30,491 boys are also married in this age group.',\n",

The wires are connected to the streetlights on the dividers.The unattended wires have their ends hanging a few inches above the divider’s surface. “I have seen many street children take this road at several points of the day. What if someday, anyone of them comes into contact with any live wire? You never know it might happen in a matter of seconds,” said Parineeta Chopra, nearby resident.In the dockWhen confronted, municipal corporation senior engineer N P Sharma said: “Even though the wires are coming out of the junction boxes and the ground, I think all the bare ends and joints are taped and none is exposed. As for the repair and restoration of the broken junction boxes and their covers, a contract with the EESL has been pending for approval this week. Evaluatation is on and once that is complete, we will fix all of these lights across the city.”',\n",

       " 'AHMEDABAD : Following the car boom of 2007-08 in Ahmedabad, when vehicle numbers surged three times that of previous year, and went up by 1.15 lakh, city planners had one seemingly obvious solution: build more and wider roads. Unfortunately, it didn’t work. The vehicular population of the city is growing at a rate up to 15% each year, forcing the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) to redesign roads and build more flyovers and underpasses.Researchers from the department of civil engineering, L D College, and KSV University, conducted a study to evaluate traffic congestion at six important intersections in Ahmedabad. They even measured the peak saturation flow of traffic — a study which describes the number of passenger car units (pcu) in a dense flow of traffic for a specific intersection lane group — at these junctions.In CG road, if the observed capacity was 5,000 PCUs, the peak saturation flow was calculated to be 7,751 PCUs. Similarly for the Paldi-Ellisbridge stretch if the observed capacity is 4,700 PCUs per hour, the peak saturation flow was calculated to be 8,369 PCUs per hour. The study clearly shows how each road hits its maximum carrying capacity during peak hours.The study found that if the observed capacity of a road like Manav Mandir to Gurukul was 4,400 PCUs per hour in one direction, the peak saturation flow on this stretch increased to 10,565 PCUs.A senior AMC traffic consultant said, “If the density of an average US city is 15 to 10 people per hectare, in India it is 150 people per hectare. When it comes to cities, this land availability gets smaller. In US and European cities, each citizen gets 3 to 4 metres of space, while in Ahmedabad it is 0.8 to 0.9 metres. For Indian cities, it becomes important for public transport to be promoted,” said the traffic consultant. He added that Ahmedabad has a density of 45 to 50 cars per 1,000 people today.',\n",
       " 'GURUGRAM: Around a dozen armed men and a woman in three SUVs turned up at the first barrier of Bhondsi jail on Tuesday morning in an attempt to attack jail superintendent Jai Kishan Chiller, who was appointed only a month ago. The attack was averted owing to the presence of mind shown by a jail warder who managed to scare the assailants away.Jagjeet Singh, IG (jail), said the prison administration has written to the police seeking increased security, but also claimed that they were capable of dealing with the “bad guys”. An FIR was registered against the unidentified assailants but the police so far have no clues about the attempt to attack the jail superintendent. DCP (crime) Sumit Kuhar said the first barrier of the jail was not in the range of CCTV cameras.According to jail warder Ram Mehar Singh, who was on duty at the first barrier, nearly a dozen armed men and a woman in two Fortuners and one Scorpio approached him around 2:30am on Tuesday. The first barrier guards the quarters of the jail superintendant and other staff, and is followed by a second barrier which is right outside the main gate of the jail.Singh said a woman, along with the driver, was on the front seat of the first SUV. The other men in the car seemed to be bouncers. The men told the warder that they wanted to meet jail superintendent Jai Kishan Chillar but the warder insisted that they place a call to Chillar first. When the men said they didn’t have a mobile phone, the warder started walking towards the guard room to call Chillar on the intercom. The men called him back and tried to bribe him. But the warder refused and walked to the intercom again. This time, the men came out of the car with revolvers and guns in their hands. The warder, however, couldn’t reach out to the superintendent and other officials on intercom, but started talking into it and pretended he was calling for the reinforcement of forces. This scared the men, who then escaped after hurling abuses at the warder and threatening to kill Chillar.“A woman was sitting in the front seat of the first SUV. The driver was wearing a safari suit and there were other men in the rear seats. They wanted to meet the jail superintendent. But the numberplates of all three SUVs were covered with black clothes and that made me suspicious. I asked them to talk to the superintendent first. One of them said they had left their mobile phone at home. So I walked towards the intercom to talk to the superintendent, but a man called me and gave me five to seven notes of Rs 2,000, which I denied. I again picked up the intercom but it was not connecting owing to some technical glitches. When I saw the men coming towards me with weapons, I put the intercom receiver on my ear and started talking. I asked for more jail staff. The men started shouting at me and asked how many persons were coming. I told them nearly five to seven cops. After that, they quickly got into their SUVs. Before leaving, they abused me and the superintendent, and threatened to kill him, no matter where he hid,” said Singh.Despite several attempts, Jai Kishan Chillar could not be contacted. Jagjeet Singh called the attack an act of cowardice. “Our cops are capable but it was early in the morning and the warder’s message did not reach us. These criminals will never be able to do anything. It was only a show-off after we took strict action against prisoners who use mobile phones and other objectionable items on the jail premises. I have alerted police and jail staff. If they try to repeat this, they will not be able to escape again,” he told TOI.Based on the complaint of Singh, an FIR has been registered at the Bhondsi police station under sections 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (unlawful assembly), 506 (criminal intimidation) of IPC and Section 25-54-59 of the Arms Act. “We have registered the case and police teams, along with our crime unit, are on job. The accused will be arrested soon,” said DCP Kuhar.',\n",

This amounts to a total of nearly Rs 130 crore. Besides this, in an unprecedented move, conditional retirement orders were issued to 200 employees who retired on Wednesday.They will not be eligible to get retirement benefits and one-fourth of their monthly pensions till charges framed against them for participating in the protests are cleared.“Regular expenditure of workers will be hit. Most of them have pending bank loans worth Rs 3- Rs 4 lakhs and with this deduction, they will be left with only Rs 4,000- Rs 5,000 this month for all expenses including groceries and bills,” said K Arumugam Nainar from the CITU-affiliated state transport union. Of the 1.4 lakh employees working with eight state transport corporations, more than 1.1 lakh workers abstained from work on January 5 after wage revision talks between the government and transport workers' unions failed.More than 70% of government buses went off the roads for nearly seven days as the government was not ready to accept the unions' demand of increasing the workers' salary by 2.57 multiplication factor. Besides this, the unions wanted the corporations to release pending dues worth thousands of crores to retired employees.During the strike period, the transport department issued a notice to all protesting employees to get back to work failing which their salaries would be deducted and disciplinary action would be initiated against them.However, the protests continued until January 12. The Madras high court referred the wage dispute to arbitration and the unions accepted wage revision by 2.44 multiplication factor as interim relief.In the past, the government has fined only those who damaged public properties during protests and others were let off with a warning or cut in number of leaves granted. But this time, the government has stuck to its ‘no work no pay’ policy, said D Mohan, an employee.\",\n",

       " 'LUCKNOW: In a special exhibition in 2010 at the Museum for Islamic Art in Berlin, a painting showed a man dressed in Nawabi aristocracy watching what the description says is ‘nautch girls’.Set in 1780 Awadh, the painting could pass off easily as that of a Nawabi ruler in British India.On closer examination, however, one would know that the admirer of the dancers was a Frenchman called Antoine-Louis Henri de Polier, who was deputed into the survey department of Nawab Shujaud- Daula.During his stay in Awadh in the 1770s, Polier was to ensure regular supply of news to the East India Company about the region’s political developments. Fascinated by India, he adopted the lifestyle of a local aristocrat. A man of versatile tastes and skills, he read many Indian scriptures in Sanskrit.He also collected rare Sanskrit, Persian and Arabic manuscripts.Letters he wrote in Persian also talk of his two Indian wives whom he had to leave behind in India before his return in 1788.In the field of art, Polier made considerable contribution to the Indian miniature painting in Awadh. Mihr Chand, a gifted local artist, created a number of notable artworks for the Frenchman.One of them being that of Shuja-ud-Daula and his 10 sons. A blend of local and European art, the paintings under the guidance of Polier had detailed instructions from him regarding theme, technique and colour.Replicas of both the nautch girl and Nawab paintings are part of the exhibiton that socio-cultural organization Sanatkada will set up at the Sanatkada Lucknow Festival.The theme for the event, held every year in the first week of February, is Awadhi-Francisi taalluqaat or the Awadhi and French connection.Close to 30 paintings to be put up for visitors at eventThe other artwork replicas which are part of the exhibition include representations of the Awadh stay of Jean Baptiste Gentil, a French Army colonel who served under Shuja-ud-Daula from 1774 to 1786.A close friend of the Nawab, Gentil was bestowed with many Persian titles by the Nawab.He even trained around 500 French troops, which comprised deserters, for the Nawab.Gentil also made a collection of manuscripts, medals and arms which he took to France with him.The paintings, now collected in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, are categorised as the Gentil album and are distinctly French in style and created by artists like Nivasi Lal and Mohan Singh.“These paintings were a beautiful discovery during our research. We were amazed at how Awadh—daily life, nature—has been depicted so intricately. The best part is that people of Lucknow will get to see these paintings when they walk into the exhibition as not all people may visit the museums they are in. It’s a whole new perspective, apart from Mughal art,” says Madhvi Kuckreja, the organizer.Apart from these, replicas of paintings from the magnificent collection of Claude Martin will also be on display, says Nimra Rizvi, the curator of the festival, adding that close to 30 paintings will be put up for visitors to appreciate.',\n",

Out of this, 418 hectare land was denotified during the previous SAD-BJP rule.The main reason for the delay in extending the Act was that studies were being done by Indian Institute of Soil and Water Conservation and the Punjab remote sensing centre on the directions of the Punjab and Haryana high court to follow a proper procedure.However, the Punjab BJP unit, in a press conference on Wednesday, opposed illegal forcing the PLPA on farmers in Kandi area of Mohali, allegedly in sheer disregard of the high court orders.

       " 'Amritsar: The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) will on Thursday begin its ‘Majha Mazboot Mission’ (MMM) from Baba Bakala to strengthen party’s mass base ahead of 2019 Lok Sabha elections. The mission will conclude on February 28, 2019, during which the party will hold 30 meetings each in 25 assembly constituencies falling in the districts of Amritsar, Gurdaspur, Pathankot and Tarn Taran. While talking to media persons here on Wednesday, in charge of AAP’s Majha zone Kuldeep Dhaliwal targeted the opposite parties for not fulfilling their promises.He alleged that the SAD-BJP alliance had assured the people to build a multi-sport stadium of international level at by-pass near Ranjit Avenue. “However, not even a single brick has been laid for initiating this project. Instead the place demarcated for the project has been allotted for parking.”Dhaliwal further alleged that instead of providing relief to the common people, leaders of various political parties had ruined public transport system in Tarn Taran, Amritsar, Gurdaspur and Pathankot districts by getting licences for their own transport companies on prominent routes in these districts. Stating that the AAP would groom its volunteers into professional politicians, he said, “Our volunteers are new to traditional style politics and don’t know much about getting people’s works done from different departments, be it police, municipal corporation or other government departments and that is why we didn’t perform well in recently concluded civic body elections. But now we have decided to groom them into professional politicians”.Notably despite winning 20 assembly seats, the party desperately failed to even register its remarkable presence in the recently concluded civic body elections in Punjab. In Amritsar alone, the AAP had fielded 62 candidates in 85 wards but didn’t register a single victory. “We were new to the civic body elections. Our candidates didn’t know how they can get work done from different departments but now we will impart them training and groom them into Punjab-style politics,” said Dhaliwal.',\n",

The residents also slammed the Congress government for not paying any heed to the demand of appointing doctors in the civil hospital, sanctioning of a fire brigade station and setting up a memorial to those killed in the blast. Earlier, a bhog was performed to pay tributes to those who lost lives.“No progress has been made in one year to solve the case and identify the persons responsible for causing destruction. We have completely lost faith in Punjab police and town residents, especially the bereaved families, want the case to be handed over to the CBI,” said Maur Blast Virodhi Action Committee convener Gurmail Singh. “Besides, the state government also failed to provide any solace to the bereaved families and also did not keep its word of providing jobs to a member of the affected families,” said committee members Naveen Kumar, Dev Raj and Jagdish Sharma.Deceased Japsimran’ father Khushdeep Singh said, “We have no faith in Punjab police and want a CBI probe so that we may know who were involved the senseless killings. We tried to approach the chief minister to request him to ask the police to speedily solve the case but he did not give us time.”Aam Aadmi Party MLA from Maur Jagdev Singh Kamalu was the lone politician to participate in the memorial service and assured to support the demands of the town residents. Even Congress ex-MLA Harminder Singh Jassi, who is said to be the target, failed to attend the memorial service. A senior police official involved in investigations in the case on the condition of anonymity said, “Police is working on some theories and have got some important leads. The counter intelligence has identified certain persons, who can be involved in the blast.”',\n",

       " \"India’s magnificent win in the third and final Test of the series will put the team in good heart for the one-day series that starts today. That South Africa will not have the services of AB de Villiers for the first three matches is a further boost to India’s chances of winning the one-day games.ALSO READ: De Villiers to miss first three ODIs as No. 1 chase beginsThe batting on a most difficult and unpredictable pitch was tremendous to watch and should dispel once and for ever the myth that Indians can't play pace. The fact of the matter is nobody can play good sustained fast bowling. Even the Don had his problems in the bodyline series and no batsman in the world can put his hand on his heart and say he enjoys playing good fast bowling. At best one can cope with it to the best of one’s ability and that's what the Indians showed at the bullring Wanderers. They showed the gumption, the guts and the determination to take the blows and hang in there. South Africa's batsmen succumbed so can we jump to conclusion and say they can't play pace?This is what the Indian team selection has to guard against, jumping to conclusions and selecting or leaving out players based on one performance. Theories about pitches and who can bat or bowl on particular surfaces also should be thrown out of the window and the best team selected. The old saying, ‘form is temporary but class is permanent’ holds good as was seen by Ajinkya Rahane’s batting in the second innings of the Test match. That may still not get him a place in the one-day series since he has been slotted as an opening batsman. This is where there's confusion. Rahul opens in Tests but is a middle order batsman for T20 internationals and Rahane bats middle order in Tests but can find a place in one dayers only as an opener. Both may eventually not play but in their interest it's important to tell them that they are flexible players who should be ready to bat anywhere in the order.ALSO READ: Great if we play only one format during overseas series - RohitThe Durban pitch is generally good for batting as the ball comes nicely on to the bat. The square boundaries are shorter so the bowlers will have to keep that aspect in mind while bowling. It is a great chance for India to win the one-day series in South Africa for the first time. They have been here for more than a month and so should be prepared for the challenge ahead.\",\n",

This comes a month after caste clashes in Maharashtra in the beginning of this month, when Dalit groups observed the 200th anniversary of the Bhima Koregaon battle. Incidentally, this has not been part of the dalit political and social discourse in Punjab.A hoarding titled, ‘Glorious history of dalits’, with a picture of the Bhima Koregaon memorial alongwith those of Guru Ravidass and Dr B R Ambedkar has been put up at Buta Mandi. The hoarding also gives a description of the battle. A shobha yatra was taken out in the area on Tuesday and thousands of people gathered for anniversary celebrations on Wednesday.The battle description recounts how Mahars, who were considered members of the lowest caste in the eyes of Peshwa Baji Rao, fought on the side of the British and defeated the Peshwa’s army, even though their strength was merely 500 while the Peshwa’s army comprised 28,000 soldiers.“The credit of this great victory goes to Mahar soldiers and dalits of the entire country are proud of them”, the hoarding reads, while mentioning Dr Ambedkar’s visit to the memorial on January 1, 1927.But no specific dalit organisation has been named on the hoarding, which simply mentions Samooh Dalit Samaj. Different dalit activists said the Bhima Koregaon battle was never mentioned during Guru Ravidass Jayanti celebrations in the past. “I learnt about the Bhima Koregaon battle and participation of Mahars in it for the first time,” said Manoj Kumar, who visited the area to participate in the fair.“Bhima Koregaon was never part of the political discourse among dalits, even in dalit intellectual and writers’ circles.

Anne Sophie Poisot, FAO advisor on sustainable agriculture, said there was a need for institutional innovations for transition from the conventional system of agriculture to a more farmer centric model.Director of sustainable agriculture program at WWF India Murli Dhar said that WWF India was promoting development of innovative technology for transforming rice stubble for packaging purposes so as to replace plastic. He added that since paddy straw management had high cost, incentives mechanisms should be developed to reduce burning and promote more sustainable options that help restore carbon in the soil.Nanda Kumar, former secretary of the union agriculture department, shared examples of some successful Indian farmers innovating through highly diversified production systems, including horticulture, fisheries and conservation of natural resources, providing higher economic and ecological resilience, high quality production and better prices. He said there was a growing consumer demand for pesticide free and healthy fresh food, and this could be a huge income opportunity for Punjab farmers.',\n",
       " \"HYDERABAD: Three-year old boy Uday Tej, who went missing on January 23 from Jeedimetla during a carnival at Chitharam temple, was traced in Siddipet on Wednesday. The boy was found with his head tonsured and face covered with towel by unknown abductors.Balanagar zone police said the boy was left in front of a locked house and his abductors fled. Some women from the locality heard the boy crying and came to his rescue. When the women enquired the child about his identity and address, a shocked Uday remained mum.The women then checked Uday’s pockets and found a piece of paper with a mobile phone number written on it. On dialling the number, the call landed with Uday’s father Bixapathi, who immediately alerted Cyberabad police.A team of police reached the spot and took Uday into their custody. Cops asked Uday about his father’s name, but he was unable to answer. Uday could only recollect his sister’s name.“The unknown accused covered the boy’s face with a muffler and a towel, before leaving him in front of a locked house, believing that he/she (accused) will return in some time. The boy’s head was also tonsured to disguise his identity from the police. It appears that due to regular searches conducted by the police to find the boy and his photos and contact details being shared among the police teams, the kidnappers must have panicked and left the boy at an isolated place,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP), Balanagar Zone, Y Sai Sekhar told TOI.Police had formed 10 teams to trace Uday. Following this development, the police have not planned to contact members of the barber community to find leads in the case. They are in search of the barber who tonsured the boy.Uday went missing on January 23 from near Chitharam temple at Gajularamaram, when his mother Sabitha and two siblings were busy doing saree shopping after completing their darshan. After realising that Uday was missing, Sabitha went in search of him, but there was no trace of Uday.The cops are still clueless about the motive behind the kidnapping of Uday and are trying to find out how the boy was abducted and taken to Siddipet. Uday's family is from Dilsukhnagar.\",\n",

Her spacious car park is transformed into an organic farmers’ market where you can pick up everything from indigenous varieties of rice and dal to groundnuts and Himalayan rock salt.Shanthi and her husband Ulhas are part of the network hosting Safe Food Sundays, an initiative launched three months ago by Organic Farmers Market (OFM), a collective of organic farming enthusiasts to make their products more accessible to people across the city.“We started with organic stores, with reStore in Kottivakkam being launched in 2006. Then, four years ago, we had a series of stores as part of OFM; they are all small hole-in-the wall shops that have come up across the city to cater to the middle class,” says Ananthoo, one of the founders of OFM.Though there are 15 such shops in the city, there were a lot of requests from people who wanted such outlets in their neighbourhoods, says Ananthoo.“They specifically wanted products from OFM. So, as an experiment, we asked them to identify spaces where we could sell the products,” he says.On Sundays, from 10am to 2pm stalls are put up at the Ulhas’ car park in Mahalingapuram.“We have a WhatsApp group where we post details of the Sunday market and people from the colony as well as from other parts of the city, such as Saidapet and Santhome, come to pick up the products,” says Shanthi, who is also the president of the Mahalingapuram residents’ welfare association.The stalls sell a variety of products — dals, indigenous as well as aromatic varieties of rice, sweeteners like jaggery and palm jaggery, groundnuts, Himalayan rock salt and unprocessed sea salt.“I used to bring vegetable from reStore home and sell it in my apartment. A few other volunteers and I thought of taking it to places where people can access these products more easily,” says homemaker Sujatha Arun, who volunteers with OFM and is also part of the Safe Food Sunday initiative. On Sunday evenings, from 4pm to 7pm, the bazaar is hosted in another courtyard-cum-cark park in Mangesh Street, T Nagar. “People need to bring their own bags as well as steel or glass containers for the cold pressed oils,” says Sujatha.With word spreading, other neighbourhoods are also eager to host the Sunday organic market.“In February, we will start in Kodambakkam and later in Kolathur and Tambaram,” says Ananthoo.',\n",

To rectify the mistake, vaccines were sent through Rohtang tunnel on Tuesday and the polio campaign will be conducted on February 4.Since Lahaul has been cut off by road from the rest of the state since December, the health department had to procure pulse polio vaccines in advance through helicopter. Chief medical officer (CMO), Lahaul-Spiti, who has been out of the district for a long time, failed to instruct his juniors to conduct the campaign along with the rest of the country. As a result, the health department failed to procure the vaccine and had to cancel the campaign. The government did not issue a schedule for sorties to Lahaul, so the vaccines were sent to the valley via the Rohtang tunnel, which is under construction.Lahaul-Spiti deputy commissioner Ashwani Kumar Chaudhary said the vaccine has reached the valley. “Polio drops will be administered to children below five years of age on February 4. The second phase of polio immunisation will be conducted on March 11. I have issued show-cause notice to the CMO and he will reach here anytime by chopper,” he said.The administration, in Spiti sub-division of the district, procured the vaccine from the neighbouring Kinnaur district. In Lahaul, the administration had the option of bringing the vaccine through Rohtang tunnel in advance. Another option was the Jammu-Kishtwar-Udaipur road but they preferred the helicopter.Block medical officer, Keylong Jagdish Kumar said all preparations had been made at polio booths in Lahaul and vaccines were expected to reach the valley by chopper on January 25. But he said the flight was cancelled and the vaccine did not reach.Health services in tribal Lahaul are in poor condition and the valley, which is cut off from the mainland in the winter, does not have enough specialist doctors and surgeons. Stuck in the snowbound valley, a number of patients have lost their lives for want of health services.After completion of excavation in the Rohtang tunnel, people hope that patients will be taken across the tunnel in cases of emergency. But this was not to be as bailey bridge on Chandra river was removed by engineers as it is established at an avalanche prone zone. The bridge connected the tunnel with the valley in Lahaul.

As the BJP is yet to take a decision to fulfill its poll promise, ABVP, the party’s student outfit, is pressing the demand to do away with the semester system. During the assembly elections, BJP accused the then Congress government of implementing RUSA hastily.RUSA, a Centrally sponsored scheme, was launched in 2013 to provide strategic funding to eligible institutions of higher education. The idea was to improve the quality of state institutions by ensuring conformity to prescribed norms and standards and adopting accreditation as a mandatory quality assurance framework.In Himachal Pradesh however, RUSA has remained controversial since its introduction. Sensing resentment among students and teachers, BJP promised its roll-back. Now that the party is in power, the BJP government realises that a roll-back is not that easy.In a recent ABVP meeting held in Solan, participants opposed the semester system under RUSA and demanded that the government scrap it. In this, the CPM is also towing the line.Before the assembly elections, BJP released its vision document, which is a now a policy document of the state government. In this, the party promised to end choice-based credit system and semester system under RUSA and to introduce the annual examination system.The BJP government recently gave administrative approval of over Rs 16 crore for construction of a building at Vallabh Government College, Mandi and over Rs 10 crore for Government College Bassa in Mandi district under the RUSA component.Education minister Suresh Bhardwaj requested the Centre to release funds under RUSA for colleges opened by the previous government without making proper budgetary provisions.Sources said the education department is preparing a detailed report on RUSA that will be discussed with the government, after which a decision will be taken by the government.',\n",

The play will be Suchitra’s first performance on stage after her role as Anna in the film Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa. It gives the audience insights into her life five years post marriage and divorce, fame, with a pinch of fiction. “Drama Queen is an irresistibly honest biographical play that will make you laugh, cry and look at the modern Indian woman in a whole new light,” says Suchitra.The play touches upon her Bollywood fame, emotional ups and downs, all in a highly dramatised manner. “The book and the play are exactly what was on my mind, but highly dramatised versions of it - like an exaggerated reality. And they do play out very well on stage. Most of it is indeed a part of my life and even many of the characters are real. Some of them were gracious enough to let me use their real names too,” she adds.The actor tells us that her initial fear of being under the spotlight after many years disappeared when the show - that premiered in Mumbai last year - was received warmly. “The audience sees the humour and finds it relatable.

       " 'Multi-coloured with artistic and often quirky designs on their bodies, with catchy names ranging from that of Gods and Goddesses to pop stars; private buses in Kerala have been style statements, unlike in other Indian states. But soon, all that might become a thing of the past, as private bus operators will have to follow the new colour coding system implemented by the government.Previously, only city buses were given colour coding — while Kozhikode buses were green in colour, Thiruvananthapuram had blue ones. Buses in Ernakulam were red earlier, but the colour was changed to blue after they started being referred to as ‘red killers’ in the media. As per the new rule, from February 1 onwards, every newly registered bus and the ones seeking fitness certificates in the State should have the right colours.City buses across the State will be painted green now, while those plying in the outskirts will be blue. The limited stop ‘ordinaries’, on the other hand, will be maroon, and all of them will have three white lines running along the sides, at the bottom. We give you a lowdown on why the officials and bus owners have decided to take the ‘not-so-colourful’ path.Why the change?Interestingly, it is the bus owners themselves who requested the change, says Joint Transport Commissioner and Secretary Rajeev Puthalath. “Many of the bus owners paint their vehicles in a variety of colours and even use different kinds of graphics to augment the look. There are some who spent more than `2 lakh for it. When such a bus runs in the same route as those owned by operators who aren’t that financially well-off, it creates an unhealthy competition. The ones with the colourful bus and their workers would feel superior, tend to overtake the others, and sometimes talk down to them. This can be a threat to road safety and put unnecessary financial burden on operators to attract people with artwork.” He also says that some of the bus operators have also tried to fool passengers into believing that they are limited stop buses, by writing ‘limited speed’ on them. “They are actually ordinary buses. But once there is a colour coding, such malpractices won’t be possible. Also, it will be helpful for the many non-Malayali people in the State to easily spot the category of the buses.”N P Sathyan, State president of private bus operators association, says that some of the passengers too have been led to think that a graphics-laden bus will have better facilities inside as well. “Many a time, the artwork looks vulgar. Some of the buses have paintings of film stars, animals etc. done in a tasteless manner. This is because there are no strict regulations about them.”The evolution of bus coloursDid you know that private buses have been a part of Kerala for more than a century? Santhosh Kumar, owner of RKV Motors, Thiruvananthapuram, says, “Our company was founded in 1933. But I am told that there were private buses even in 1901, in Kerala. They were the English model buses. They were open, with only railings on the sides with a few seats within, so they couldn’t have colours.”Santhosh says that buses which had a covered body came later, with a bonnet-like projection in the front, like in cars. “They were imported and were often termed mookku chappiya (flattened nose)bus. Our company had them till around 1975. Around 1955, a company named Fargo introduced the full forward buses, the type we see now, which had their engines inside. After that, Ashok Leyland and Tata also brought out similar buses. We were the first to buy a full forward bus in Kerala, in 1956.”According to Santhosh, the buses in those days had an aluminium body, without any colours. “Glazing aluminium used to be the body of even KSRTC buses, from 1965 onwards. It was in the late 60s that operators tried colours for the first time. It started off with coloured lines. In 1970, we first introduced double-colouring on buses – one colour on the top half and another on the bottom. In the 80s, single colours were used for the entire bus and in the 90s, colours with lines came into existence.”Rajeev says, “It’s only in the past five or six years that heavy-duty graphics started getting used in buses. Till then, the colours and the designs were simple.”The other sideAccording to Centre for Public Policy Research (CPPR) Chairman D Dhanuraj, what needs to be changed is the branding and marketing of private buses, not colours. “Auto rickshaws and taxis have a colour coding system. A problem with that is that in the event of a crime or harassment inside one, it won’t be easy to identify it, as all of them look the same. However, if it’s an online taxi service, for instance, the whole company will be held responsible for the same.

The play will be Suchitra’s first performance on stage after her role as Anna in the film Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa. It gives the audience insights into her life five years post marriage and divorce, fame, with a pinch of fiction. “Drama Queen is an irresistibly honest biographical play that will make you laugh, cry and look at the modern Indian woman in a whole new light,” says Suchitra.The play touches upon her Bollywood fame, emotional ups and downs, all in a highly dramatised manner. “The book and the play are exactly what was on my mind, but highly dramatised versions of it - like an exaggerated reality. And they do play out very well on stage. Most of it is indeed a part of my life and even many of the characters are real. Some of them were gracious enough to let me use their real names too,” she adds.The actor tells us that her initial fear of being under the spotlight after many years disappeared when the show - that premiered in Mumbai last year - was received warmly. “The audience sees the humour and finds it relatable. Many women have told me that they identify with the story or that they can imagine their mother reacting similarly. My friends, parents and daughter have all liked it. In fact, my mother is a central character in the play and was laughing out loud.”',\n",
       " 'Raja Simha, which hits screens today, is a film that is close to actor Anirudh’s heart. Produced by Veer Masthi Movies and directed by Ravi Ram, the film, he says, is a commercial flick and here’s why it is a must-watch this week…It’s been eight years since my father-in-law (Vishnuvardhan) left us. His films were always about uniting people and the community, with special emphasis on women empowerment. His fans told me that such movies weren’t made anymore. Raja Simha fulfills their (audiences) wish. They will feel inspired after they watch the film.The film is a commercial flick with elements of comedy, romance, action and more. There are six songs, which audiences will love. In addition to this, there are also four fight scenes, which have been incorporated very well in the film.The star cast and the technicians, who have worked on the film, have given their best. We have two beautiful heroines — Nikita Thukral and Sanjjanaa Galrani — who are so hard working. They have been so supportive in every aspect; they are so tech-savy and so active and have been promoting the film. Then you have legendary actors like my mother-in-law, Bharathi Vishnuvardhan, and Ambareesh. I am fortunate to work with actors like them and it’s been great to share screen space with them. Even actors like Sharath Lohitashwa, Arun Sagar and Bullet Prakash have given their best. The movie is incomplete without its technicians and the rest of the cast. My wife, Keerthi, has worked on the costumes and my children are featured in one song.I have also undergone a complete makeover in this film. It is a far cry from my earlier image, where I have always portrayed romantic-comedy roles. This film will be a surprise as I have lots of action sequences. I have worked very hard on my character and had to prepare well for it.Raja Simha is a merger between real and reel life. We have tried to show real-life situations in a symbolic manner. People will relate to it, they will connect with the storyline and the scenes.',\n",

But now, it looks like the film has gotten into trouble as the officials from Performing Animals Sub Committee (PASC) of the Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI) has come out stating the permission for rekla race shooting was denied by the committee and that the makers went ahead with the shoot without any approval.‘They said that rekla race won’t be shown in the film’When they approached us for the pre-shoot permission with the synopsis of the film, we rejected it straightaway. Rekla race is banned by the Supreme Court. So, they said that rekla race won’t be shown in the film. Later, it’s only when Suriya uploaded photos of the rekla race from the film’s shooting spot that we came to know about it. Despite us denying permission to shoot rekla race, they went ahead with it. Now, they will be facing legal consequences.— A PASC member‘Rekla races are legal in TN’Speaking to us, Rajsekar Karpoorasundarapandian, CEO and director of Suriya’s production house, clarified, “The AWBI has not given permission going by the Supreme Court’s ruling, but they have not taken into consideration the amendment that has been made by the Tamil Nadu government to the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, which makes conducting not just jallikattu but also rekla races legal in the state.”In December 2017, the government had contested a PIL that claimed that conducting rekla races violated the Supreme Court’s ban, and the PIL was dismissed then.Rajsekar added, “The AWBI should have asked us for clarification and given us an opportunity to present our case. We applied for prior permission, which is not technically necessary, because they can also be on the spot. We shot these scenes during an actual rekla race competition. As such, there are very few bulls in our state and we could get them in huge numbers only during such an event. This was organised in Thirumayam (near Pudukottai) by president of the committee for rekla races in Tamil Nadu, and we shot on the sidelines of the event, with vehicles for thehero, the villain and a few other characters.”Once we get the order officially from them, we will be giving them a reply stating all these facts, he said.',\n",

       " 'A lone woman, sitting with wilted flowers and an anti-pollution mask, on an over-sized chair, next to an air quality index monitor with giant lungs that tells you just how bad the air is that we breathe. That’s what artist Avril Stormy Unger has been doing since Monday — for 10 hours each day — for her performance, titled Only Time Will Tell.So, why is Avril putting herself through a grueling 10 hours each day, being exposed to noise and air pollution throughout? And why the giant lungs and over-sized chair? The chair, says Avril, is a means to attract people’s attention. Having done a similar performance under the Double Road flyover, without any installation piece or placard, she says that she was unable to communicate with people from higher economic classes. “The conversation needs to be had with that class of people, who have just one person driving in the car, or have a family with four cars — one for each member. I want to get the message about air pollution across to those people,” says Avril.And although her message is stern, her approach is anything but. Sitting on a footpath on Old Madras Road (next to Sampurna Montfort College), all by herself, throughout the day has had people going up to Avril, enquiring about her wellbeing. And what began as concern soon turned into conversations about the deterioration of our natural spaces and the urgent need to tackle air pollution. “I have received a lot of empathy from people and that is what I want to invoke. This is a new medium to a lot of people, so it feels impactful. Since I have one-on-one conversations with them, people seem extremely moved. They keep coming back to check on me, offer coffee and coconut water, and even suggest ideas. When they see someone going through what I am going through every day, they can relate to it because it’s another person going through that. It has much more of an impact when compared to a poster,” she says.THE IDEA BEHIND THE INSTALLATIONFor nearly three years, Jhatkaa.org has been putting the focus on the deteriorating air quality in Bengaluru through their various campaigns. “What we realized is that a lot of people don’t really understand the health impact of air pollution. This is a conversation that we had when we found that anti-pollution face masks turned black in 2-3 months due to the pollution. We wanted people to see what this means to be exposed to bad air all the time. So, we worked with artists, who used the filter material to make giant lungs, which we placed on the air quality index monitor, which shows in real-time what the pollution levels are. Collaborating with Avril was a natural progression, since she had already done this earlier,” says Avijit Michael, director, Jhatkaa.org.And at the end of three days (which is when we spoke to Avijit), what colour had the lungs turned? “It’s quite grey. We thought that it would take a month for the lungs to turn black, but in three days, it’s already visibly grey,” he adds, leaving us with something to seriously ponder over.',\n",
       " 'M D Ramanathan used to make a keertanam his own, by adding some interesting tidbits to it. Once you hear MDR’s version, you would feel that something is absent when you listen to it elsewhere. Here’s how he once tweaked the Tyagaraja kriti Nanu Palimpa Nadachi Vachitivo…” Prince Ramavarma went on to narrate a story, after singing the composition Parakelayana by the legendary musician, in raag Mohanam.Those listening to Ramavarma on Wednesday night at Tripunithura — an annual programme held in honour of MDR for the last 16 years — were in for a double delight. They were not just treated to MDR’s evergreen compositions, but accompanying Ramavarma on stage was Padma Bhushan Dr T V Gopalakrishnan on mridangam. Not any mridangam but the legendary MDR mridangam, which was specially made by TVG decades ago, to accompany the musician who passed away in 1984!TVG says, “MDR used to sing at a pitch that was too low. Normally, we cannot have a mridangam for that pitch. So, I made this specially for him using blackwood (karuveetti) and it was played only when he sang. I am playing it here after all these years at this concert and it feels quite special.”Ramavarma explains, “It was difficult for many instrumentalists, especially violinists and mridangam players to perform with MDR as the instrument won’t go as low as his pitch. He sang in A scale, while most singers sang in D, D sharp or E. So, some of them used to make instruments specially, to perform with him.” He adds about TVG, who is also a noted Carnatic and Hindustani musician who has performed with the like of George Harrison of Beatles for years together, “Mridangam owes a lot of its innovation to him. Earlier, people used to place it on their legs and adopted a crouching posture to play it, which used to affect their back. TVG made an equipment to place it on, so that they could play in a healthy posture. Similarly, mridangam artistes used to apply a paste of rava (semolina) on it for the sound effect, which would often come off, midway through the concert. It’s TVG who made a built-in rava adhesive, which solved the problem. This was in the seventies and eighties. Traditionalists used to question it, but now everyone is following these methods. Also, he is the one who made a mridangam with fibre glass, which can be easily dismantled while travelling. Before that, travelling abroad with a mridangam was a tough task due to its size.”Ramavarma adds that he owes his musical career to TVG. “It’s his efforts for almost three years, from 1987 to 89, that urged my folks to allow me to be a musician. So, for me it is matha, pitha, guru, daivam and TVG!”The audiences at the venue were mostly those who have been frequenting the event for the past many years. Says Shankar Sivan, a school teacher, pointing at the super blue blood moon of the sky, “I would say MDR’s voice was as rare a phenomenon as that…What greater joy than listening to his Nandagopa Yasoda or Manasa Sriramuni, that too as TVG plays on his mridangam?” as he quickly gets back to enjoying the concert. Meenakshi Raman, who came to attend the concert all the way from Bengaluru, says, “MDR is my daughter’s father-in-law and I myself have been a fan of MDR’s music for years. I am here with a message for the programme and all the musicians here, from his son Balaji, who is now in the US.”The show’s organiser himself is an ardent MDR fan, R Krishnamoorthy from Kochi, who has been holding the event since 2003. He has also authored a novel, Kedaram, based on the life of MDR and the various struggles in his career and has a collection of over 200 audio recordings of MDR. “I feel that when MDR compositions are presented here, it invokes his presence, and that’s what gives me strength to hold it, every year.”',\n",

Balwant Singh, who has seven goals in ISL Season 4, could have almost doubled his tally for Mumbai City FC against Jamshedpur FC.Instead the hosts suffered the ignominy of suffering their third consecutive loss at home, to Jamshedpur. The 2-1 win takes the visitors to the fourth spot with 22 points while Mumbai remain in the sixth position with 17 points from 13 games.Jamshedpur scored in the 37th minute when Farukh Choudhary moved from the left to the centre, nutmegged defender Gerson and shot. The ball took a deflection of another defender's heal to trickle in.It was a half where Mumbai City had virtually no chances. JFC sat in front of the Mumbai defence and thanks to the skills of Choudhary, Azuka Izu, troubled the home team's backline.But things changed in the second half when Mumbai started looking dangerous as they pushed forward with purpose.For a period of 18 minutes, Mumbai created so many chances that if all had been converted to goals, Mumbai's victory target would have been 7 goals.Instead Balwant went on to put a show of how to miss goals from open chances. He headed wide, headed straight to the goalkeeper, shot straight at Subrata Paul _ he was not even creative in missing chances.But Mumbai did find an equaliser in the 79th minute through Everton Santos who headed in from a flag-kick. But five minutes later, in the 84th minute, Bikas Jairu scored from a rebound after Kervens Belfort's effort was blocked by Mumbai goalkeeper Amrinder Singh.\",\n",

Desai had moved the bail plea, citing change of circumstances after the Bombay high court stayed the trial against him on December 19, 2017.His lawyer Milind Pawar said, “We also brought to the court’s notice that Desai has been in the jail for too long when most other accused in the case are out on bail. Besides, police have filed a chargesheet in the case and there has been an inordinate delay in the framing of charges by the trial court.”Some of the high court’s observations on April 13, 2017 while admitting, for final hearing, Desai’s criminal revision petition against the Pune court’s rejection of his plea for discharge from the case, were cited in support of grant of bail.However, the district government pleader opposed the plea and submitted that the high court’s observations cannot be taken into consideration at this stage. Moreover, Desai’s bail pleas filed before and after his arrest were rejecsted by the trial court and the high court too rejected his bail plea.

One of his complaints was about the civic body suffering a loss of around Rs90 crore in the contracts awarded for various road projects, worth Rs425 crore. The standing committee had approved them in December last year.Patil said, “The contractors bagging the civic projects have not changed in the past 15 years. Nor has their number. Earlier, these contractors submitted bids below 20-30% of the estimated cost. But now they are submitting bids and getting contracts at rates little below the estimated cost. As a result, the civic body will suffer a loss of Rs90 crore in these projects.

I am sure that the civic body will be able to save around Rs50-60 crore if re-tendering is conducted and new contractors submit their bids.”He added, “I have also complained about the allotment of transfer of development rights (TDR) worth Rs5,300 crore flouting the rules after the BJP came to power in PCMC.

Maharashtra is likely to get about Rs 43 crore from this country-wide allocation, state health officials said.The scheme aims at improving treatment outcome, reducing relapses, increasing survival rate. It is going to be pivotal to the government’s plan to eliminate TB by 2025, experts said. “The direct cash benefit will also act as an incentive to complete treatment and reduce number of treatment defaulters,” state tuberculosis officer Sanjeev Kamble said.In Maharashtra, nutritional support scheme was started as a pilot project in 2014-15 and later funds were also allocated to municipal corporations under National Urban Health Mission (NUHM) for TB patients.Initially, there was a lot of debate over providing cooked or uncooked food. After deliberations, the Centre decided to transfer direct cash benefit to patients’ accounts every month till the full course of treatment.“Basal metabolic rate of TB patients is around 15% more than healthy individuals. Hence, nutritional support is crucial to improve treatment outcome and reduce mortality,” Sandeep Bharaswadkar, consultant for state TB programme, said.Nutritional support improves patients’ immunity and helps in early recovery from the disease. “It also helps in preventing relapses,” Bharaswadkar added.',\n",

The only good news is that it has improved from the mid-term exam’s overall pass percentage of 21.5%.A disappointed deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia has asked the director of education to take action against subject teachers and heads of schools where the pass percentage is significantly low. He has pointed out that several schools have scored below 10% and “there cannot be any justifiable reason for schools to be unable to support the learning of their students to the extent that not even 10% children are able to secure the minimum pass marks in each subject,” he has said in a letter to the department of education.This is a nudge to officials on the ground to get involved and figure out why children are faring so badly.However, subject teachers say they are helpless. Their biggest challenge is the low learning outcome of those who come to their classes.According to an English teacher from a school in south Delhi, her students have trouble comprehending the basic text. So, she is now getting them to learn answers to run-of-the-mill questions by rote.“They don’t understand basic and obvious questions posed to them but are expected to undertake complicated comprehension and reading exercises. How much can they do in a year and how much can we achieve in the same time? So, now I get them to learn the answers to very basic three-four mark questions so they can at least score something,” said the teacher.Another teacher traced the problem back to the introduction of Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation (CCE) which was “misused” for a 100% result.She said the department had itself, over the past eight years when CCE was in force, had asked teachers to make sure students passed irrespective of how much they actually learn or score in class. “If we failed a student, there would be a memo from the department that despite such relaxations why are we not getting a 100% result,” the teacher said in exasperation.She explained that to begin with the passing percentage had been pegged at 33% but was brought down to 25%. “Later, the percentage was calculated by adding both SA1 and SA2. The students would fail in their exams but we had to pass them. They didn’t have to work to score and have lost touch with writing and studying,” she said.A chemistry teacher pointed out that truancy is another factor. “Children leave home but never turn up for class.

       " 'The budget has offered a mixed bag for the fisherfolk. While the announcement extending Kisan Credit Cards has thrilled the fishing community, they say the allocation for the sector is far from satisfactory. The credit card would come in handy for them since they depend heavily on loan sharks for their fishing expenditure. It will also help them get into the credit delivery mechanism like their counterparts in the farming sector.Fishermen require cash ranging between a few thousands of rupees — for those going fishing daily on traditional country boats — and lakhs of rupees for deep sea fishermen going on month-long expeditions. They use the money to procure fuel, provisions and fishing gear for their expeditions. Fishing is considered a high risk sector as fishermen in general don’t get loans from banks with the result that they tend to borrow from local loan sharks for fishing expenses. Based on the catch, they repay the debt but are bogged down by their debt burdens most of the time, since the catch is unpredictable.“Extending a Kisan Credit Card-like setup will help fishermen a great deal because they struggle with debts taken from loan sharks. It will be more beneficial to small and marginal fishermen in particular who will be brought into the credit delivery mechanism. It will also be helpful in depositing the subsidy components directly to their cards”, said an official of the state fisheries department in Chennai.Seconding the opinion, activist U Arulanandam of Pamban in Ramanathapuram district said that fishermen were trapped in debts taken from loan sharks. “It is early to comment on the credit card mechanism but we will be thankful to the central government if they find some method to get the community out of the net debts”, he commented.The fact that the central government had set aside Rs 10,000 crore corpus funds for animal husbandry, dairy and fisheries has also aroused the curiosity of the community. With about 1,076 kms of coastline, Tamil Nadu constitutes 15 % of the total coast length in the country, coming next only to Gujarat. Frustrated with the ongoing fishermen row with neighbouring Sri Lanka, efforts are under way to move the state’s fishermen into deep sea fishing.There is also a longpending demand among fishers for an exclusive ministry for fisheries. Creating a huge corpus fund for the sector has raised hopes among the community that it is a first step towards a fisheries ministry. “At the end of the day, fishing still remains riskier. The central government measures should be aligned towards ensuring safety of lives and crafts of the fishing community”, Arulanadam added.However, Nanjil P Ravi, spokesman of National Union of Fishermen Association, said that the fish exported from the ten coastal states fetched Rs 60,000 crore in revenue for the Centre. “But in this budget only Rs 10,000 crore has been allotted for the fisherfolk. No mention was made of the fishermen affected by Ockhi and nothing was said about the plans to protect fishermen from floods,” he added.“Fishermen have to buy their own diesel, boats and nets, and no subsidies are given. We are charged road tax when we use no roads in the sea. It is a spine-breaking budget and the fishermen are not happy with it,” said Ravi.',\n",

Washington became emotional while delivering his acceptance speech.\"People around me have been great and always wanted me to do well. I have a lot of people to thank as they have supported me in each phase of my life,\" said an emotional Washington, before adding, \"Mohammed Asif Ali sir has been very generous in offering the Amir Mahal grounds for practice during my formative years. He has gone out of the way to ensure I received top-notch practice facilities at the ground. The inputs and constant support provided by Venkatramana sir have helped me become a better cricketer.\"Former India off-spinner Venkatramana believes Washington\\'s real test will be to stay grounded in the coming years. \"Washington\\'s biggest strength lies in his self-belief. He is never overawed by the batsman\\'s credentials and backs his abilities. It is this quality that has helped him go places. All he has to do now is to continue working hard and stay grounded,\" he said.Washington has hardly spent time with his parents and elder sister in the last few years. \"I have not spent a lot of time with my family but they have been amazing especially my elder sister Shailaja. It is difficult to describe in words the encouragement they have given me,\" said Washington, who was bought for Rs 3.2 Crore by Royal Challengers Bangalore at the recently-held IPL auctions.Sundar, Washington\\'s father, revealed how his son began concentrating more on his bowling in the past few seasons. \"Former Tamil Nadu cricketer D Vasu had the firm belief that Washington had a bright future as a bowler. Vasu predicted that Washington will go on to become the No. 1 spinner for Tamil Nadu in the coming years. From that point of time, I began working a little extra on Washington\\'s bowling and the results are there for all to see. While he always stood out as a batsman, Vasu\\'s inputs helped Washington improve his bowling as well,\" Sundar said.',\n",
       " 'Pune: The Union Budget announced the Eklavya model in the tribal areas of the country to increase the reach of education in remote areas. But the Maharashtra government is heading in the opposite direction by shutting down schools in the remote areas because they lack adequate student strength.Educationists are divided about the usefulness of such schools. The residential schools, called ashram shalas, for tribal children, are in a bad shape and instead of opening new schools, funds should be used to improve existing infrastructure, they said.Finance minister Arun Jaitley said by 2022, every block with more than 50% ST population and at least 20,000 tribal people, will have an Ekalavya model residential school. They will be on par with Navodaya Vidyalayas and have special facilities for preserving local art and culture besides providing training in sports and skill development.Activists in the education sector felt it will make the government the good person on paper. “The government should strengthen the ZP schools. It should provide more facilities to Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas and ashram shalas. Tribal children are leaving school because of poor management,” an activist, who did not wish to be identified, said.Education activist Matin Mujawar called the move to open new schools a political gimmick. “Instead of wasting money on new schools, improve existing schools, provide infrastructure, given them biometric attendance and CCTVs will go a long way. What is the point of putting money in Ekalavya schools when we have ashram shalas functioning out of tin sheds and the students there dying of snake bites,” he said.Former chairman of Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Vasant Kalpande said if the schools are made on the basis of JNVs or Kendriya Vidyalayas, then it will be a great way to give educational opportunities to tribal children.“These schools have produced bright students and if this is replicated in tribal population in Maharashtra through Ekalavya schools, then it will be a great way to bring the population into the mainstream,” he added.',\n",

But as the girl was not able to provide details about the suspect, it took some time for the Pune rural police to crack the case.The probe revealed that the suspect used to rape the girl on the pretext of offering her sweets. He has been charged under Section 376 (rape) of the Indian Penal Code and the relevant sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.An officer of the Pune rural police told TOI that the 16-year-old girl was mentally challenged.

However, it failed to address creation of additional capacity or jobs in the manufacturing sector. The reduction in corporate tax is a big thing. Over all, the budget has a lot of length, but not much of a depth as far as the industry is concerned,” president of Mahratta Chamber of Commerce, Industries and Agriculture (MCCIA) Pramod Chaudhari said.PC Nambiar, director, Group EXIM, Serum Institute of India, said the budget concentrated more on rural and social development. “It cannot be called a business or corporate friendly budget,” he added.Industrialists said there were hardly any surprises in the budget. “The annual budget is not as important as it is made out to be since announcements (about industries) are made throughout the year. However, the reduction in corporate taxes for MSMEs with a turnover of up to Rs 250 crore is a good move and should boost employment in the sector. The introduction of long-term capital gains tax on Rs 1 lakh or more is also encouraging,” KPIT Technologies CFO Anil Patwardhan said.Creation of clusters for food processing was termed a good move. “We are hopeful that Pune features as one of the clusters. The 372 reform action points identified at different places should increase the ease of doing business in the country,” director general of MCCIA Anant Sardeshmukh said.Aspi Kolah, director, Forbes Marshall Pvt Ltd, said, “The FM spoke of so many schemes.

There is a need to hold the government accountable on how they spend this money,” he said.MCCIA secretary Vishwas Mahajan said while the budget has provided a lot of opportunities for growth in the technology sector, there was no clarity on taxation on investments in startups. “There was also no mention about cyber security or software exporters in the budget speech,” computer expert Deepak Shikrapur said.',\n",

He made an allocation of Rs 5,35,000 crore for 28 ring roads across the country, including the proposed ring road in the city.The ring roads in Pune and Bengaluru have been put on the priority list. These roads are expected to ensure better connectivity to highways, reducing the ordeal of travelling through the “congested” interiors of the city.Besides Pune and Bengaluru, Varanasi, Lucknow, Amritsar, Jalandhar, Nagpur and Amravati would also benefit from ring roads under the Bharatmala project. Jaitley said 35,000km of roads would be laid in the first phase of the project at an estimated cost of Rs5,35,000 crore.Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA) commissioner Kiran Gitte told TOI that of the 32km stretch of the ring road’s first phase, land for 12km had been acquired. It would connect Satara highway to Ahmednagar highway.PMRDA had sought Rs 2,468 crore for it. He said they were now upbeat about getting the funding, which would speed up the link road.The total cost of the 129km ring road, linking three highways around Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad, is expected to be a little more than Rs 17,000 crore. Of this, Rs12,000 crore is expected to be funded under the Bharatmala project. The remaining funds would be generated through town planning schemes and land monetization models, Gitte said.The ring road is expected to decongest the traffic on internal roads in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad because most heavy transport vehicles would travel on it. The ring road link would improve the traffic flow on internal roads as well.Besides the ring roads around big cities, the Bharatmala project would cover 45 bypasses, and 34 projects of expanding lanes and flyovers. All these works would be undertaken in the next one-and-a-half years to end traffic congestion in urban areas.The focus of the entire programme is to provide better connectivity and improve mobility. across the major cities in India.',\n",

I feel the selection would also take this into consideration. The consistency that we have shown over the past few years would also be a plus. I am sure the selectors will look at the entire picture — the kind of work that we do here and the research that we are pursuing.”He said. “If we are selected, the funding will help us compete with the top universities, which is the state’s ultimate aim for the IoE scheme.”',\n",
       " 'Pune: The setting up of the National Housing Bank (NHB), as proposed in the Union Budget, is expected to give a boost to the affordable housing segment in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad.“The setting up of NHB will benefit affordable housing projects with dedicated funds for Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana schemes. Usually, it gets difficult for the realty sector to get funds as they are not on the priority list of financial institutions,” Shrikant Paranjape, president of Credai (Pune Metro), said.In last year’s Budget, affordable housing was given an infrastructure status. “NHB will help in easing fund disbursal for the realty sector,” Maharashtra Credai president Shantilal Kataria said, adding that their request to increase PMAY subsidies and remove taxation on unsold inventory was not addressed in the Budget.Rohit Gera, MD, Gera Developments, said even as the NHB has been the only announcement under affordable housing in the Budget, realtors should adopt a wait-and-watch approach as far as implementation is concerned.Developer Sachin Kulkarni said the taxation of income from investments in mutual funds may bring back investors to real estate.Besides affordable housing, realtors said there was nothing much to look forward to in the Budget. “These sops are not enough to soothe the negative impact of note ban and GST. We were looking for some deduction in the corporate tax, which did not happen,” Rajesh Mhatre, CEO, Vascon Engineers Ltd, said.',\n",
       " 'PUNE: For senior citizens, the fall in bank interest rates over the years has been depressing. But hope sprang with the Union Budget 2018 focussing on the welfare of the elderly.From the exemption of interest income to raising the limit of deduction for health insurance, the budget gave overall concessions of around Rs 4,000 crore in extra tax benefit for them.Senior citizens, who continue to uphold Pune’s legacy as a pensioners’ paradise, also agreed with finance minister Arun Jaitley about “a life with dignity is a right of every individual”.Sukhdev Singh Garewal, 82, an army veteran and former employee of Hindustan Aeronautics, was on his evening walk at Chittaranjan Vatika in Model Colony, as were others who were out exercising and socialising. Their discussions were about the interest income from banks and post offices. “We are happy about the increase in the interest income which would give those of us in the 30% income tax bracket about Rs 12,000 more a year in hand,” one of them said.Garewal was indifferent to the budget proposals, especially the sops for senior citizens.“I just learned about his announcements on exemption of taxes on interest income. If one is suffering from diseases, then it’s good for them. But that covers only some people. Other steps should have been taken for senior citizens,” Garewal said. He is “generally favourably disposed” towards the current government.The minister did not address the prices of essentials, SB Sonawane, a former Pune Municipal Corporation employee, said. “All prices have gone up due to taxes and cesses. Everything, from medicines to food items, is costly. There were no announcements about jobs creation,” he added.He said Jaitley announced LPG and electricity schemes for the poor and also cut taxes for the rich. “The money will come by taxing the middle class by imposing all those cesses. So it’s not a balanced budget,” he said.Supriya Nadgir, 68, a retired public employee, said the new long term capital gains tax was an annoyance. “ Jaitley has imposed a long term capital gains tax on equities. Many senior citizens have acquired a corpus by investing in SIPs. He should have at least exempted senior citizens’ SIPs from that tax. Making senior citizens file IT returns every year is annoying and an added expense.”She was piqued by the “exploitation” of the salaried class in the budget. “Jaitley said the salaried paid more in income tax than business owners. So why did he make the salaried class suffer more? No changes to tax slabs, and now the new cess and capital gains tax, it seems unfair,” she said.',\n",

This will bring down the outlay this year to Rs 14,264 crore, from last year’s Rs 17,810 crore. Also, sources claimed a major chunk of available funds is likely to be handed out to Metro projects nearing completion.About 190km of Metro lines are expected to be commissioned soon in Delhi, Chennai, Bengaluru, Ahmedabad, Nagpur and Noida.Pune Metro rail officials are hopeful they will receive the required funding. “We are yet to get specific details regarding Pune Metro,” Brijesh Dixit, MD of MahaMetro, said.The city’s Metro project is hoping to get a total of nearly Rs 700 crore during the 2017-18 financial year. It has, so far, received Rs 580 crore and has spent Rs 300 crore.Activists said it’s unlikely Pune will be given monetary priority. “Funding priority is based on the progress of work. Projects that are in their final stages will receive more money — not the ones that are struggling, or slow-paced,” Prashant Inamdar of Pedestrians First said.According to Metro officials, through 2018-19, around Rs 300 crore will be required for the Communication-Based Train Control (CBTC) system. Also, MahaMetro plans to finish work on a station at Sant Tukaramnagar, along the Pimpri-Swargate line, by December this year. The station is expected to cost Rs 50 crore.

They, however, welcomed the allocation of Rs 7,148 crore for textile sector, of which Rs 2,300 crore was earmarked for Amended Technology Upgradation Fund Scheme (ATUFS).But they said allocation of Rs 2,255 crore for Rebate of State Levies (RoSL), one of the four incentives given to exporters, was inadequate. They were also disappointed that their demands for knitwear development board and ESI multispecialty hospital didn’t find a mention in the budget.The RoSL scheme came into effect on September 20, 2016 and the actual requirement for our apparel sector till March 31, 2018 is Rs 5,000 crore (average 3.5% of FOB value of garments).The concern is that the made-up sector has also be given RoSL benefit out of the allotted amount,” Tirupur Exporters’ Association president Raja M Shanmugham said. “Tirupur, the knitwear hub of the country, should be given importance when it comes to developing infrastructure facilities. We have been demanding for a Knitwear Development Board for long as there isn’t an industrial body to connect with policy makers. But the budget has no mention of it,” he added. Shanmugham, however, welcomed the relaxation in corporate tax for MSMEs and also hailed the proposed amendment to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) to reduce women employees’ contribution to 8% from 12% for the first three years of their employment. “Since it was the last budget for the Narendra Modi-led government, it has made many positive announcements, including Rs 3 lakh crore for Mudra scheme, of which 76% will go to women,” said KS Babuji, general secretary, Collar Work and Hosiery Small Industries Association.The budget also did not go down well with the industrial trade unions. “The Tirupur Trade Unions Federation had unanimously made an appeal to exempt job work sector of the industry from GST since it attracts a cumulative tax rate of 40%. But the Union finance minister didn’t do anything about it” said N Sekar, general secretary, Banian Factories Labour Union, Tirupur AITUC. TNN',\n",

The state contributes more than 35% of the total exports and has leather clusters in Ambur and Vaniyambadi in Vellore.Reduction in the minimum employment period from 240 days to 150 days and the additional 30% income tax deduction for leather and footwear sector for new employees would encourage more employment, industry sources say. \"The extension of 25% reduced corporate tax to MSME units having turnover of up to Rs 250 crore will benefit the leather and footwear industry as 90% of the industry is concentrated in the MSME segment,\" said Aqeel Panaruna, vice-chairman, Council for Leather Exports.\"Enhancement of customs duty on footwear from 10% to 20% will enhance competitiveness of domestic footwear industry and will promote Make in India programme,\" he said.

Tamil Nadu has 6.89 lakh registered SMEs contributing to over 15% of the total units in the country.For the textile industry, the benefits would help battle competition with sops narrowing the difference in wages with competing nations, officials said. Wages, which account for about 12% to 15% of the production costs in garment making, are about 25% cheaper in Bangladesh, a key competitor for the country in textile exports.\"These initiatives will help the sector to become competitive and face challenges from Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Vietnam,\" said A Sakthivel, regional chairman, Federation of Indian Export Organisations, southern region. \"Extending 12% EPF employer’s contribution for the first three years and also fixed term employment would encourage job creation in the textile industry,\" said P Nataraj, chairman, Southern India Mills’ Association. \"About 80% of textile units would benefit from the new corporate tax rate,\" he said.Garment units in Tirupur were given incentives that included the Centre bearing employer’s contribution to the employee provident fund for new workers who are earning less than Rs 15,000 per month during the first three years and an increase in overtime from three hours to eight hours per week in June 2016.',\n",

They were involved in eight attention diversion cases in Coimbatore and four more cases in other parts of Tamil Nadu, police commissioner K Periaiah said.When a police team was about to nab them from a lodge at Mettupalayam, the gang escaped from there and travelled to Nagapattinam and Kanyakumari.

       " 'Chennai: This World Wetlands Day, three water bodies in the city have another lease of life thanks to joint efforts by the civic body, public works department and non-governmental biodiversity research organisation CareEarth Trust.The water bodies that have been restored are Narayanapuram lake in Pallikaranai, Perungalathur lake, and the Korattur-Madhavaram-Ambattur lakes.CareEarth Trust co-founder Jayashree Vencatesan said a study by a team of researchers from her organisation revealed that while smaller wetlands have disappeared, mid-sized wetlands have lost their area by nearly 65%. “The reservoirs that we chose for restoration are unchanged in terms of area and capacity. Several other water bodies in the city have either been reclaimed as terrestrial systems, or their water holding capacity compromised and the area ruined due to solid waste and sewage disposal,” she said.In terms of cleaning efforts, Narayanapuram lake, said Vencatesan, had a thick sheet of water hyacinth, an invasive weed species, which was cleared using earthmovers. “Authorities of a temple and administrators of a church in the area extended their support without which the work would not have been completed on time,” she said.In Perungalathur, sewer water from nearby areas as well as from a couple of industrial units had drained into the lake. Vencatesan and team, with the help of the local community, approached the management of a private company, which readily agreed to plug the sewer lines that drained into the Perungalathur lake.For the Korattur, Madhavaram and Ambattur lakes, which are spread over 160 hectares, the CareEarth Trust team has given the Public Works Department a detailed proposal for restoration.“Maximising the wetland area, improving ground water recharge, conservation of the native species of flora, and creating areas for community interaction were some of our main objectives, said Vencatesan.Besides the scientific assessment, the organisation also held community outreach events, the most popular among them being a street play in which a king laments the condition of the Perungalathur lake. “This street play became very popular among locals. In Narayanapuram, we held a painting competition for local children with the theme ‘My Beautiful Lake’. The children were asked to suggest ways to protect water bodies,” said Vencatesan.',\n",
       " 'Trichy: In a decisive step, the corporation on Thursday brokered an agreement with a private environmental organization to supply quality ‘alternate’ fuel processed from fresh dry waste, to an Ariyalur-based cement factory.The move is also intended to prevent the waste from being piled up at the corporation’s dump yard in Ariyamangalam. With the tie-up, the corporation will be able to generate 12,000 tonnes of alternate fuel, as it is named, from fresh dry waste and transport it to the cement factory, for the next two years.The corporation has entrusted IL&FS Environmental Infrastructure & Services Limited, a private organization, to reuse the biodegradable and non-biodegradable and the company would also be given 300 tonnes of waste collected from the city for segregation.Subsequently, the organisation employing 40-45 labourers and peculiar waste processing machines would segregate the waste each day. As the biodegradable waste would be stored in pits for preparing manure, the accumulated processed waste during manure making will be identified along with the flammable potential dry waste.Following the identification and segregation, the dry waste identified as potential elements for alternate fuel will be further segregated based on calorific value (quantity of heat produced by the complete combustion of a fuel.Sources involved in the process said that maximum emphasis would be given on avoiding wet and non-flammable elements. Only potential waste having calorific value more than 3,500 KJ/Kg will be sent as alternate fuel to the cement factory, the said.“The agreement is to supply the Ultratech Cement production plant in Ariyalur with 12,000 tonnes of alternate fuel per year processed from waste entering the dump yard. By doing so, for next two years, we can certainly prevent the fresh dry waste generated by city from getting piled up in Ariyamangalam dump,” K Viswanathan, manager operations of IL&FS plant in Trichy said.As the city is provided with 23 micro compost yards that collect, segregate and reuse the waste each day, the waste collected from container and compactor bins placed at public spots would be processed for identifying potential dry waste to be used as fuel in cement plant.“For two years from January 31, 2018, till January 31, 2020, fresh waste entering the dump yard will be reused to the maximum possible extent either in compost making process or for being used alternate fuel in Ariyalur cement plant,” a senior corporation official told TOI.It is said that the process to supply alternate fuel for cement factory would not cover the waste piled up in the 47-acre dump. On Thursday, first consignment of alternate fuel processed from city’s waste was flagged off by the corporation officials from Ariyamangalam dump yard.',\n",

According to Fernando, he joined shipping company, which owns 12 ships, in 2007. While he was on board MV Woodgate, which was drifting on the waters of Japan, the captain of the ship found that some fishing nets had got entangled in the propellers of the vessel. Fernando was called upon to remove the nets, which had to be done manually.He was lowered on a rope and he did the job, but in the process, suffered severe damage to his lower back. Medical records revealed that he required hip replacement and was permanently disabled.However, medical attention was denied to him by the shipping company.

The new wireless technology will enhance broadband cellular network by providing high speed connectivity than its predecessors 3G and 4G.IIT-M director Bhaskar Ramamurthi said the proposal is to build an end-to-end test bed for 5G technology across multiple locations interconnected with a high-speed fibre-optic network. The test bed will have start-of-the-art indigenous equipment where products that will work on 5G technology can be tested for performance and compliance. \"It will incorporate several new technologies developed from scratch, and are compliant with the emerging global 5G standard to which India is making significant contributions; in particular it will include internet of things, millimeter wave communications, network function virtualisation, LiFi, and network security,\" he said.The test bed will be developed by a team of researchers from IITs in Bombay, Kanpur, Delhi, Hyderabad, IISc Bangalore, CEWiT (Centre for Excellence in Wireless Technology, IIT Madras) and SAMEER under the ministry of electronics and IT. The team will be led by IIT-Madras. Several startups may emerge from this effort, Ramamurthi said.Experts said the faster 5G technology will provide a platform for emerging areas of machine-to-machine communication that can be applied in manufacturing units (communication between robots), smart homes (devices reading EB meters and consumption data), smart cities and smart grid. While 4G will continue to exist, the faster 5G is expected to increase subscriber base.\"With machine-to-machine communication, we might be sending data frequently to enhance services, and a network of devices may be transferring data at the same time.

The petitioner’s claim that Shylaja is Jayalalithaa’s sister is utterly false,” he said.In 1980, the year Amrutha claims she was born to Jayalalithaa, the latter was busy acting in four regional films and was simultaneously writing a series for a famous Tamil magazine. This apart, there was video proof of her presence at the 27th Filmfare awards function in Chennai, he added.Pointing out a defamation complaint pending against Shylaja, initiated by the Tamil Nadu government when Jayalalithaa was chief minister, Deepak said, “If the petitioner’s claim that she and Shylaja met Jayalalithaa many times in Poes Garden and Bangalore is true, why would Jayalalithaa disown Shylaja by filing the defamation case?”On the last rites for Jayalalithaa, Deepak said, “Such things depend upon the circumstances. Jayalalithaa was chief minister and leader of the ruling party. The ideology of the party and of its followers would prevail in the matter.

But instead of reducing, the budget further burdened the sector by levying a cess of 0.3%. Similarly, the duty on coloured stone and diamonds has been proposed to be raised from 2.5% to 5%,” said Jain.Ajay Kala, another prominent jeweller in the city, said as per the budget proposals, imitation jewellery would now be charged 20% instead of 15%.Rajasthan is the hub for coloured stones and much of it is exported.Jain said the city traders were competing with countries like Thailand, China, Hong Kong and Japan where the interest rates were low and the industry enjoyed other facilities.“Our products will be rendered uncompetitive with such additional tax burden.

       " 'CHENNAI: A Revin Raja is a second-generation candle maker in Tirunelveli, following in the footsteps of his father Arul Raja who had been in the trade for three decades before the turn of the millennium.What candle makers in Arul Raja’s time did not face, and what has put a big question mark over the survival of manufacturers like Revin today, is the proliferation of China-made candles in the market. With the Union budget announcing a customs duty hike on imported candles up to 25% from the existing 10%, local manufacturers have been offered a chance to match up to the cross-border onslaught.While making the announcement, finance minister Arun Jaitley noted that the duty hike had \"substantial potential for domestic value addition\".The move has been welcomed by candle makers in neighbouring states too. P J Jose, secretary, Kerala state candle manufacturers’ association, said the proposal offered much needed breathing space for local players. \"(The announcement) will give a fillip to the domestic candle industry. It is the need of the hour for small time entrepreneurs like us who have been struggling to produce profit due to mass influx of cheap China made candles,\" said Jose, co-proprietor of Popular Candles in Edapally, Ernakulam district.Chinese candle manufacturing costs are remarkably low due to availability of cheap paraffin wax and even cheaper labour.For the industry in Tamil Nadu, supply of paraffin wax is via the Indian Oil Corporation Limited-operated CPCL plant in Manali or the Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited-owned Numaligarh Refinery Limited (NRL) in Assam.\"Paraffin wax from CPCL costs us Rs 88 per kg. Compared to China where the raw material is available for less than 40 per kg. But CPCL paraffin wax is high quality,\" said Revin Raja, who runs Annai Candle Industry in Vallioor, Tirunelveli.It is this massive difference in production cost that local candle makers hope will be cut by the customs duty hike. Though paraffin wax is not the only type used to make candles there are others like foam wax and soya wax manufacturers say there was a general lull in demand from customers for locally produced candles. One reason is that, unlike the US and other Western nations, candles are not among the top fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) in India.\"If you shop at a supermarket in Chennai, chances are that you would not find a Tamil Nadu-made candle. Customers usually buy birthday candles and regulation size common use candles. These are segments where there is an abundance of Chinese variants,\" said M Jegan Jose, proprietor of Sahayamatha Candle Manufacturing Unit, based out of Maduthuvilai in Nagercoil, Kanyakumari district.Though Jegan is hopeful, he is not fully convinced the customs duty hike will have the desired effect. \"Maybe, in north India, where the concentration of small candle manufacturing units is less, candle makers may benefit,\" he said.',\n",

       " 'PANAJI: Ranjit Bajaj feels it will be a disaster if Minerva Punjab FC do not hold on to their lead at the top of the table and win what will surely be recorded as the unlikeliest of I-League triumphs.Aizawl FC’s triumph in the I-League last season was touted as a fairy tale with comparisons to Leicester City’s title-winning effort in the English Premier League. But Bajaj’s relatively-unheralded team has done even better, and should they put it across Churchill Brothers SC at the Tilak Maidan in Vasco on Friday, they would have gone one step closer to winning the title with half the money that Aizawl spent last season.“I would be lying if I said we were aiming for the title. I thought top four would be good, because there was word that the four best teams would qualify for the Super Cup. But, now that we are close to the I-League title, I find it surreal,” the flamboyant owner told TOI on Thursday.Bajaj better believe in what he is seeing. At least the points table does not lie. With seven games left to be played, they are now six points ahead of East Bengal with a game in hand, nine points ahead of Mohun Bagan and two ahead of Neroca, who have played two additional games. Mathematically, the title is theirs to lose, and they would be celebrating wildly should, as expected, they pocket three more points on Thursday.“We’ll celebrate if we beat Churchill. That would mean 80 percent of the job done. Then we would have a nine-point lead (over East Bengal) and playing five of our remaining six matches at home,” said Bajaj. The only away clash is against bottom-placed Chennai City FC.Should, as neutrals across the country are hoping, Minerva pull off a miracle, Bajaj would have sent an important message across: You don’t need big budgets to sustain a club and win trophies.Minerva’s Rs 1.4 crore budget is among the least in the I-League; even newcomers Neroca FC have spent Rs 2.1 crore this season, and is half of what Aizawl spent last season.“People will be shocked to know the kind of money that we are paying the players. What I am telling the world is that it’s financially viable to run a football club. You don’t need to pay crazy salaries, as long as you don’t get 36-year-old tried (foreign) footballers,” said Bajaj.Minerva’s best-paid Indian player earns less than Rs 50,000 a month. That’s half of what at least three foreign players get as bonus for scoring a goal in the I-League or providing an assist.Even Churchill Brothers, with a tightened purse, have spent more on bringing and rejecting foreign players. There was a time when Churchill attracted the best foreign players, broke the bank for Indian stars and won two I-League trophies. Minerva could now win their first trophy, with a ridiculously low budget.',\n",

As per the proposals, the import of solar tempered glass for manufacture of solar cells will be exempted from customs duty. The decision will reduce the cost of manufacturing and eventually the cost of solar modules and power systems. Earlier, the duty was 5%.In his speech, finance minister Arun Jaitley said, “Many farmers are installing solar water pumps to irrigate their fields. Solar electricity is generated by farmers using their lands. The government will take necessary measures and encourage state governments to put in place a mechanism to purchase surplus solar power produced by farmers by distribution companies or licensees at reasonably remunerative rates,”Sunil Bansal, general secretary, Rajasthan Solar Association (RSA), said that power for agricultural sector was adding stress to the Discoms as they were subsidized. If solar pumps can be encouraged, then the burden on the Discoms would reduce.“The idea is good but it needs infrastructure to connect the solar systems in the fields to the distribution network,” added Bansal. Rajasthan is one of the leading states where solar pumps are increasingly used and the government also provides subsidies for such systems.',\n",
       " 'CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu will not be able to make use of the nearly Rs 50 crore guaranteed under a mission fund announced in the Union budget on Thursday to raise bamboo that would have allowed hundreds of forest-dwellers and tribals in the state to raise bamboo as a means of livelihood, says former principal chief conservator of forests C K Sreedharan. The reason, he said, is because bamboo is still classified a tree in the state.In November 2017, Sreedharan said, the Union ministry of environment, forests and climate change promulgated an ordinance, excluding bamboo from the definition of trees under Section 2 clause (7) of the Indian Forest Act 1927. All states that are governed by the central act can now make use of the fund. But the state, which is still governed by the Tamil Nadu Forest Act 1882 is in force, can only do so if it amends this legislation to reclassify bamboo as grass, he said.A dozen years ago, Tamil Nadu promulgated the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act 2006, a key legislation vesting with forest-dwelling tribes and other traditional forest dwellers the right of ownership, access to collect, use and dispose of minor forest produce, traditionally collected within or outside village boundaries.Minor forest produce includes all non-timber produce of plant origin, including bamboo, brushwood, stumps, cane, tussar, cocoons, honey, wax, lack, tendu or kendu leaves, medicinal plants, herbs, roots and tubers, but its administrative definition in the Tamil Nadu forest department excludes bamboo. This needs to be revisited in tune with the 2006 act, said Sridharan.Even the Hill Areas (Preservation of Trees) Act 1955, where section 2, clause (g) classifies bamboo a tree and says it can be cut only if it grows to a certain height and girth, is detrimental to raising it in the state, he said. There is a serious error in framing of the Act, he said, adding that it should be amemnded .To allow the raising of bamboo in the state, all three pieces of legislation need to be amended by excluding bamboo from the category of trees, he said.',\n",

While the big talking point in the state has been the reduction of corporate tax for companies having up to Rs 250 crore, there is actually quite a few announcements that has struck a chord with the people here.The focus on reducing infant mortality rate, animal husbandry, solar energy, tourism and affordable housing reflects the interests of the state. Additionally, the Rs 5 lakh health insurance for 50 crore people, the standard deduction of Rs 40,000 crore for salaried class, reduction of exercise duty on petrol and diesel created a positive vive among the people.“The finance minister has tried to please every segment of the population. After demonetization and the GST, people wanted some relief and the FM did not disappoint even though he did not raise slabs for tax exemptions. But at the end of the day, it all boils down to implementation which is the key,” said Kapil Sharma, a private sector employee.Most of the industry in Rajasthan in the MSME sector. The reduction of corporate tax by 5% to 25% will benefit 99% of the companies whose turnover is less than Rs 250 crore.“A tax relief of 5% will provide a huge boost for industry in Rajasthan. Now the companies will have more cash in their hands as working capital. Hope, this also leads to capacity expansion and job creation,” said Suresh Kumar Poddar, an industrialist.While there are not any Rajasthan-specific announcements like for other states, the state can take advantage from many of the proposals.“It all depends on the bureaucracy to sensitize the respective departments for preparing action plan and tapping the funds available in all these schemes,” said Anand Singhal, an educationist.Being a penultimate year budget before the general elections, the FM seems to have given the people some cheer after the demonetization and GST ordeal but how this would translate into a electoral mandate will be only known next year.',\n",
       " 'JAIPUR: The Congress sweep in Rajasthan bypolls is bound to strengthen PCC chief Sachin Pilot who has been facing competition from former chief minister Ashok Gehlot and AICC general secretary C P Joshi over the state leadership.Though Joshi has largely stayed away from the state politics for past several years, since the recent Gujarat elections, Gehlot supporters’ chorus has been growing louder with the demand that the latter be declared Congress’ CM candidate as was done in Punjab. The bypoll results, however, would make it difficult for the Gehlot camp to counter Pilot’s leadership in Rajasthan.If Gehlot is credited for taking Congress closer to victory in Gujarat, Pilot has ensured actual triumph for the party in Rajasthan. The party’s success in the state under Pilot has been continuous, right from the panchayat and municipal areas to parliamentary constituencies. Last year, the party swept Zila Parishad bypolls in Banswara, Bhilwara, Jalore and Karauli districts, besides leading over BJP in the panchayat samiti bypolls in 19 districts.“Be it the bypolls for four assembly seats in 2014, the Dholpur assembly bypoll last year or the three bypolls now, Pilot has toiled hard campaigning with the party candidates in the field. Unlike some senior leaders who participate in just the road shows on the last day, he walks with the candidates deep into the rural areas every single day,” said a PCC office-bearer.The Ajmer Lok Sabha bypoll was more like a direct contest between Pilot and chief minister Vasundhara Raje, who not only spent majority of her campaigning time in the constituency but also stationed her best and trusted ministers there. Moreover, Raje had accorded ministerial status to BJP MLAs/leaders in almost every assembly segment of the constituency. Still, Congress secured more than 50% of the votes polled in Ajmer Lok Sabha where Pilot led the party campaign.Commenting on the bypoll results, Pilot said, “Congress president Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi gave me the responsibility to revive the party in the state and that is what I have tried to do.” At a press conference in Jaipur, he credited Gehlot, Joshi and Congress’ Rajasthan in-charge Avinash Pande for the party’s success. “Rahul ji’s leadership has shown us the way,” Pilot said.',\n",
       " 'CHENNAI: With finance minister Arun Jaitley announcing in his budget speech on Thursday that railway stations with a daily footfall of more than 25,000 would be provided with escalators, at least 12 stations in the city’s suburban train network are likely to get the facility.These include important stations like Tiruvallur, Avadi, Chengalpet, Guindy, Arakkonam, Pazhavanthangal and Chromepet, which recorded more than 25,000 originating passengers per day, as per data from the 2016-17 financial year.However, Southern Railway officials are tight-lipped about the stations where the scheme will be implemented as it is not yet clear if the benchmark will be originating passengers or total footfall at the station.\"If the total footfall is taken into consideration, more stations will get escalator services,\" an official said, adding that they would take a call as per the Railway Board’s advice.At present, escalators are provided at MRTS stations on the Chennai Beach-Velachery route, but at many stations they are poorly maintained or not operational during some periods of the day. In suburban stations like Tambaram and Chennai Egmore, there are either one or two escalators and the facility is so convenient that there are complaints when they are stopped for a day or two for maintenance work.K Baskar, a member of Chennai Divisional Rail Users Consultative Committee, welcomed the move. He suggested that Railways should carry out a proper survey of the footfalls recorded at suburban stations.\"For instance, if I buy a ticket from Chennai Central to Putlur, it costs Rs 10, which is the same as Chennai-Tiruvallur. So the system will count it as a footfall at Tiruvallur station and not Putlur. This means smaller stations where there is no electronic record of footfalls will stand to lose out on amenities,\" he said.',\n",

People were expecting announcements to improve the economy. However, their hopes have been dashed,” he added.The salaried sector is disappointed as no relief has been provided in income slabs. Also , no benefit has been provided to small scale industry.

Deputy Commissioner of police, (crime) Vikas Pathak said the accused was arrested with Rs 3 lakh in cash, firearm and fake identity cards. “He led his gang to loot ATMs and steal cars in Goa, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Delhi, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Gujrat etc.Islamuddin and his gang used to rob luxury cars from national highways at gunpoint and used them to uproot ATMs. Eight of his gang-members were nabbed by Tamil Nadu police a few months ago after which the accused came on the police’s radar. “The Coimbatore police had come to Jaipur and shared their information with us after which he was arrested in Mansarover,” Pathak said.On June 6, 2016, the accused and his gang members robbed a car from an inspector of Haryana police in Gurgaon. They kidnapped him and robbed him of cash and ATM card. They dumped the cop near Mathura. The gang targeted trucks transporting copper wires from warehouses. “He made a fortune by selling these copper wires in black market. But her later switched to ATM burglary,” the official said, adding that they used to loot cars and its owner and dumped them at secluded places.He led his gang to uproot over two dozen ATMs in Madurai, Coimbatore, Goa, Kerela and Maharasthra. “He is a big catch because he had been wanted in so many cases of rape, loot, extortion and murder,” Pathak said.The police said that the accused’s history sheet is filled with almost all serious offences that could be found in Indian penal code IPC. “He never hesitated in opening fire at anyone, that made him such a terrifying criminal,” an official said. The Tamil Nadu police had been tacking him for past several months, they finally located him in Jaipur with the help of surveillance.',\n",

Finance minister Arun Jaitley said that 10 prominent tourist sites in the country would be developed into ‘Iconic Tourist Destinations’ to boost tourism in these regions. Besides, tourist amenities will be upgraded at 100 Adarsh Monuments of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) across the country.“Rajasthan had sent proposals for Amber Fort and Pushkar. We hope to get at least one of the two to be developed as an iconic destination,” said Hridesh Kumar, director of archaeology and museums.The FM also said that the National Heritage City Development and Augmentation Yojna (HRIDAY) to revitalize heritage cities would continue to gain momentum.A few Adarsh Monuments in the state are also likely to get infrastructure boost with facilities like Wi-Fi, signages, pathways and beautification. Additional works like garbage removal, rainwater harvesting, disposal of waste, public conveniences, wastewater management, etc. would also be undertaken.According to Dr D N Dimri, director (antiquity), ASI Headquarters in Delhi, “Rajasthan has a few monuments under the Adarsh Scheme. They are Kumbhalgarh, Chittorgarh and Ranthambhore forts, Deeg Palace, Arthuna group of temples and the Saas Bahu Temple. A lot of work has been undertaken at Kumbhalgarh.

He was transporting cows to Nuh in Haryana after purchasing them from Jaipur. They were attacked near Jaguwas in Behror on National Highway 8.Khan’s family had maintained that they had valid documents to transport the cows. However, police said they did not have the required permit.“The permit is issued by the collector of the district from where the bovines are bought and required to transport cows to another state. We kept asking the family to produce the transit permit, but they never submitted it. Initially, we had registered a case under sections 5, 8, 9 of the Rajasthan Bovine Animal (Prohibition of Slaughter and Regulation of Temporary Migration or Export) Act, 1995 and Rules, 1995,” said a senior officer with the Alwar police.“We have maintained the same charges filed earlier in the FIR against Pehlu Khan and five others,” the officer said.After the FIR was lodged, the family had produced the purchase bill for the cows.The Meo community to which Pehlu Khan belongs had also accused the police for not arresting the culprits, and alleged that a weak chargesheet was against them. “Police are trying to prove that Pehlu Khan is a smuggler while not clarifying who killed him,” said Sher Mohammad, former ‘sadar’, Meo panchayat.',\n",
       " 'Jaipur: The crisp Rail Budget presented by Railway Minister Piyush Goyal is going to be meaty for the North Western Railway (NWR). With a good allocation of funds, the authorities at the NWR are upbeat and expecting the completion of electrification work on Delhi-Ahmedabad and Jaipur-Sawai Madhopur routes by the end of this year. Besides, CCTV cameras will be installed in major trains including Shatabdi Express (Jaipur-New Delhi) and Rajdhani Express (Jaipur-Ahmadabad).Goyal has proposed for electrification of 6,020 kms of rail network in the country.“Out of this, the NWR has been given a task to compete the electrification work of 930 kms.

       " 'Jaipur: Rajasthan bypolls have rung the alarming bells for ruling BJP, both at the Centre and in the state. People in two parliamentary constituencies and one assembly seat spread across three regions of the state have completely rejected BJP by giving a clean sweep to Congress in the bypolls held on January 29.In the results declared on Thursday, Congress recorded comfortable victories in Ajmer and Alwar Lok Sabha seats as well as in Mandalgarh assembly (in Bhilwara district) seat. All three seats were earlier held by BJP but the deaths of its MPs and MLA necessitated the bypolls.What should worry BJP more is that Congress has taken a lead on all 17 assembly segments — eight each in Ajmer and Alwar parliamentary constituencies and one Mandalgarh seat — in the bypolls, which were dubbed as semi-finals before the assembly elections due in December. Initial reports suggest a massive swing of vote percentage in favour of Congress in these assembly segments as compared to 2013 and 2014 elections.“Since people have given a lead to Congress in all 17 assembly segments, which are spread across different regions of the state, it’s a clear rejection of BJP and its policies. Chief minister Vasundhara Raje, who got a splendid opportunity with a massive mandate in 2013, failed on every front in fulfilling people’s expectations. She should now resign on moral grounds,” said Sachin Pilot, the PCC chief. He added, “Since these elections for parliamentary seats were held after ‘notebandi’ and GST, it is a mandate against the BJP government at Centre too. Congress will make a comeback not only in Rajasthan this year but also in other states and at the Centre.”Chief minister Raje later tweeted, “We have worked tirelessly over the years, with the people of Rajasthan as our centre of attention and shall work harder, with renewed fervour and dedication, taking our beautiful state to new heights.”The biggest victory for the opposition party came from the Alwar parliamentary constituency where Congress’ Karan Singh Yadav defeated BJP’s Jaswant Singh Yadav, a cabinet minister in the Raje government, by a margin of over 1.96 lakh votes. Karan, who made a comeback to politics after nearly a decade, has won the seat for the second time (2004-2009). Former Union minister Bhanwar Jitendra Singh had lost the seat to BJP’s late Mahant Chand Nath in the 2014 general elections.For the state Congress, the most significant victory is of Ajmer Lok Sabha, which has been the constituency of Pilot. CM Raje had begun campaigning in Ajmer district much before the bypoll dates were declared, hoping to crush the opposition party’s morale with a Congress defeat on Pilot’s political turf. Once the bypoll dates were declared, Pilot chose not to contest but campaigned harder and ultimately left the ruling party stunned by registering a victory with over 84,000 votes for his party candidate Raghu Sharma.Sharma, an ex-MLA, defeated BJP’s greenhorn Ramswaroop Lamba, son of former union minister Sanwarlal Jat whose demise led to the bypoll for Ajmer parliamentary seat. Congress victory in Ajmer is likely to silence Pilot’s detractors in the party’s state unit. “After attempting polarization on religious lines, BJP tried to polarize people on caste lines. But people, especially the youth, have rejected BJP’s divisive politics,” Pilot said.The first result declared in the day was of Mandalgarh assembly seat, which had a triangular contest since a Congress rebel was in fray as an independent candidate. Congress candidate Vivek Dhakar, however, recorded an easy victory by defeating BJP’s Shakti Singh Hada with a margin of almost 13,000 votes. Independent candidate Gopal Malviya secured around 40,500 votes. The assembly seat was earlier represented by BJP’s Kirti Kumari, who succumbed to swine flu in August last year.Conceding defeat, BJP state president Ashok Parnami said, “We respect people’s mandate and shall analyse the reasons for our defeat.”BJP had won all 25 Lok Sabha seats in Rajasthan in the 2014 general elections. After the bypoll results, the Lok Sabha score now is 23 for BJP and two for Congress from the state. The ruling BJP, which wrested power from Congress in Rajasthan in 2013, had 161 MLAs in the assembly of 200 members. The assembly score now has been rearranged to 160 for BJP and 25 for Congress.',\n",

While he reintroduced standard deduction — it was scrapped in 2004-2005 — Jaitley did away with medical and transport allowance, except for differently abled persons, and hiked cess from existing 3% to 4%.The standard deduction is now Rs 40,000, which will translate into a small saving of Rs 194 for a taxpayer with an income of Rs 5 lakh and Rs 150 for an assessee with income of Rs 10 lakh. But for taxpayers in a higher income bracket, the new tax measures will actually increase liability.According to a calculation provided by PWC, the tax liability on income of Rs 25 lakh will increase by Rs 3,713 and the liability for income of Rs 75 lakh by Rs 20,584. In fact, at an income of Rs 12,62,400, the benefit from Rs 40,000 standard deduction will be completely offset by the loss due to additional 1% cess.Read: Full text of Arun Jaitley's Budget speechUnder the earlier regime, an assessee could get deduction of medical expenses up to Rs 15,000 upon production of bills under Section 17(2) and a transport allowance of Rs 19,200 under Section 10(14)(ii).In total, an assessee used to avail deduction of Rs 34,200 against medical and transport allowances.

He also stressed an important point — the average tax paid by a salaried class taxpayer is higher at Rs 76,306 as against average tax of Rs 24,753 paid by individual business taxpayer.He said apart from reducing paper work and compliance, the decision to allow standard deduction will also benefit the pensioners, who normally do not enjoy any allowance on account of transport and medical expenses.

       " \"NEW DELHI: With real estate prices dropping in many cities, property is sometimes sold at prices lower than the government-fixed circle rates.To address the taxation problems that arise from this gap, the Budget has proposed tax relief for buyers and sellers by allowing property to be valued at up to 5% below circle rates for calculation of stamp duty and capital gains tax.Circle rates, also known as ready reckoner or guideline value, have been revised upwards by most local governments over the last 15 years.Circle rates were introduced to prevent tax evasion by declaring a lower sale price of the property on paper. Stamp duty is collected either on the sale proceeds or the circle rate value, whichever is higher.But now that real estate prices are sliding in many cities such as Delhi-NCR, Bhopal, Kolkata, Lucknow and Jaipur, circle rates are higher than prevailing market rates.So a person may sell immovable property lower than the circle rate, but the registrar office still charges stamp duty at the circle rate. Once the sale is completed, the income tax department deems the difference in the circle rate and sales value as unaccounted money, and taxes both the buyer and the seller.To minimise hardships in genuine transactions, finance minister Arun Jaitley proposed that no adjustment shall be made when the circle rate value does not exceed 5% of the consideration.Developers, however, say this is not enough and that stamp duty should be levied on real transaction value and not on the circle rate value.Ramesh Nair, CEO and Country Head, JLL India, said the proposal would reduce difficulties for sellers. “With this, the government has recognised that there could be price variations within a zone or locality that has the same circle rate,” he said.WATCHHome for everyone is govt's priority, says FM\",\n",

But when Panditji arrived, he had something else in mind. On his request, the table and the chairs were removed and a carpet laid out. He sat crossed-legged with his instrument, the Mohan Veena, as long-time acquaintance and tabla wizard Bickram Ghosh started the conversation and took him through the different phases of his life.“When I was very young — 15 perhaps — a beautiful German woman came to visit us with her guitar. Till then, I had a smaller version of the guitar. But when she walked in, I was like, ‘Wow’. I thought I’d Indianise her,” said Panditji jokingly, to which Bickram replied, “But you Indianised her guitar instead!” The members of the audience broke into laughter at this exchange.While talking about his Kolkata connection, Panditji expressed his gratitude to Bhabasindhu Biswas, the man who helped him making his Mohan Veena.Apart the intense and colourful discussion about his musical journey, Panditji swept the audience off their feet with two short, impromptu performances. Bickram, who wasn’t carrying his tabla, played the tambourine with Panditji for a fascinating duet. “I have heard him playing live, but in a bigger space.

       " \"You will find an ardent Zakir Hussain fan in a 20-year-old and an 80-year-old — that is the magnificence of the maestro’s music. On stage, he speaks the “tabla language” and off-stage, he can jam with you on any topic that matters and moves him — music, musicians, movies or Mumbai. In his universe, he is nothing short of a superstar. And what’s striking is the unbelievable humility with which he carries his lengthy list of achievements, and the legacy of his music forward. His journey, from listening to 'Binaca Geetmala' on radio to being a rage in the world of percussion, is fascinating. At the end of our long chat, he observed that my cuppa chai had turned cold, but for the stimulating conversation that flowed, who would need a shot of caffeine? Read on...Not every artiste can keep up with the changing times, which does not mean that they aren’t as brilliant today as they were earlier. It is about being relevant to the new generation. But you will find a Zakir Hussain fan across age groups. What would you attribute that to?The idea is to stay plugged into your roots because a tabla player will always be a tabla player, and sitar player will always be a sitar player. When we are playing, we are representing a long lineage and history, and we are flag-bearers of that music and tradition. Once that becomes second nature to you, then it is something which will always go with you wherever you go. The trick is to not let that overpower everything else. I must find a balance between what I represent and what is out there, which will help me connect with people who speak a different musical language. I should be able to speak tabla language in English, Hindi, Marathi, Persian or whatever else. And when I do that, I will connect with people in a more panoramic way. Similarly, once you are able to interact with musicians from various genres of music, and various generations of music, you make yourself relevant. For instance, if I am a 60-year-old tabla player working with a young Niladri Kumar, Rakesh Chaurasia or Rahul Sharma and I don’t look out of place, it means that I am relevant. So, when the audience sees Niladri and me interacting on stage (even if they are fans of Sitar Funk and that music), then, at that point, the generation gap is not relevant anymore. Instead, what remains relevant is that we are making good music together. Having said that, I am still myself and I have always been that way for the last 40-50 years, so the people who have been listening to my music all this time can see that even though I am working with younger musicians, what I bring to the table is what has been inside me all this time.Last year when we spoke about your father Ustad Alla Rakha Khan’s barsi, you had said that you use this stage as a stepping stone for new projects. What will be the highlights of the concert dedicated to Abbaji tomorrow?This year we have a drummer coming in — Marcus Gilmore, who as far as contemporary jazz, free form, progressive jazz, and jazz rock is concerned, is the flavour of the month. He will be teaming up with Avishai Cohen, a trumpeter from New York (who is also one of the three best jazz trumpeters in the world) along with me and other musicians from India. I am also keeping in mind the tradition that I started since 1996, of travelling with percussionists all over the world, including Indian artistes and this year won’t be any different. What is important is not that the musicians play together, but the fact that they vibe well and get to know each other as human beings. If that happens, the music part will take care of itself as they are such great musicians.It is important for masters like you to pass on the tradition and your learnings; do you see a lot of youngsters still keen on learning classical music?It is not just about Indian music; I think nowadays people around the world are interested in learning about art and culture. It is a universal phenomenon. I think various online platforms have helped people become more aware of what’s happening musically in different parts of the world, and it has made it possible for us to enjoy various art forms and be enthralled by them. Secondly, today, there is a newborn confidence that being an artiste is an acceptable profession. Thirty years ago, it was not that way. Music as a profession wasn’t on the same social level as other professions. Now, it is acceptable and possible for people of all social shelves to be a part of it. Add to that, there is also a newfound economic confidence and there are outlets available for aspiring musicians to make themselves known. Today, there are hundreds of young musicians who can interact with each other compared to the 1960s, when there weren’t so many musicians of my age who I could connect with. I had to exist in the company of artistes who were 10-12 years older than me. In this day and age, an artiste like Niladri Kumar has so many drummers or tabla players of his age group who he can work with. That makes experimenting and learning a little more fun and relaxing, rather than being in the presence of a great master and having to be a certain way.Long back you had said that India is very open as far as appreciating music from the West and absorbing other forms of music is concerned. At what stage were you exposed to music beyond Indian classical forms, and how did you adapt to it?The only thing I was exposed to was 'Binaca Geetmala' (weekly radio countdown of top filmi songs in the 1950s hosted by Ameen Sayani), which we would eagerly wait for. Back then, we would only listen to the radio and sometimes go to Rhythm House (a music store in Mumbai that shut down) to look for records, but we rarely found any music from outside of India. I was lucky, because when I was quite young, my father would bring me foreign records. Every now and then, we would get a chance to listen to Cliff Richard or The Beatles on the radio. Fortunately, I started travelling abroad at a young age, hence, I came in touch with some great music, but it took me a long time to get comfortable, as I didn’t grow up listening to it. I came in touch with other forms of music when I was about 19, so it wasn’t a simultaneous process. Today, musicians are exposed to it all at the same time, so they can work at being Indian musicians, while also familiarising themselves with music from around the world. Maybe our grounding was better, I have no idea, but I do feel that today, young Indian musicians are more equipped to interact as musicians of the planet than we were at their age.Your father was one of the first classical musicians to compose music for Bollywood. Didn’t you want to follow suit?Originally in the 1940-50s, most of the film music was composed by classical musicians, but then it changed because the film industry realised that to reach a large number of people, they needed to make their music more palatable to the masses. So, all sorts of elements were being tried, and a lot of Western classical music and jazz crept into film songs. It made it difficult for classical musicians to survive in that field. There were musicians like Shankar-Jaikishan, Kalyanji-Anandji, Laxmikant-Pyarelal and RD Burman who could work on both ends of the world, and they did well. Classical musicians did not develop a temperament for it and were not able to keep up with the times. For me, as a young musician, playing for Bollywood movies was an exciting process. I learnt to be a part of a disciplined system, whereby in a three-and-a-half minute song I had to do everything that I could think of. The learning helped me a great deal when I started playing with Western musicians. Also, being a classical Indian musician, I believe in improvisation and spontaneous creativity, hence, when it comes to playing film music I find myself in shackles. Mostly, the music composed for a film cannot be changed once it has been put together. It is difficult to come to terms with the idea that if in the second verse of the song you feel like interjecting a certain rhythmic idea, you cannot. There is a whole orchestra playing and you have to adhere to what has been preset for you. That, I think is what often makes it difficult for an Indian classical musician to work in the film world. Also, I have been too busy playing at concerts and travelling. I do about 140 shows a year, and that doesn’t leave me with much time. Nowadays, I believe producers are not sticking to one music director for a movie; instead, they are going ahead with multiple music directors for an album. Maybe, now it will be easier for me to do one song in an album.Do you listen to a lot of film music that is being made? What is your opinion of it?I have many young musician friends like Salim-Sulaiman, Vishal-Shekhar and Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy who are composing music for films and they often ask me for feedback on their music and compositions. The kind of work that they are doing is amazing. I think that film music directors in India are mutants, in a good way. Nowhere in the world have I seen a composer who is able to give an Indian classical song, folk song, a song with a jazz beat, rap or a hip-hop drum-based song — all this in one album. This is very unique. It is a talent which is unparalleled and I haven’t seen this anywhere in the world. So, I feel that today’s Indian film music will eventually set the tone for what the future of music might be.FACEBOOKTWITTERPINTREST\",\n",
       " \"GAYA: Chief minister Nitish Kumar inaugurated the three-day Bodh Mahotsava in Bodh Gaya on Thursday.The event is organised to promote cultural tourism in the land of Buddha's enlightenment. Inaugurating the event, the CM denounced the recent acts of subversion that resulted in explosion and planting of IEDs at sensitive points. He said that both the state and central agencies are engaged in investigation to bring the culprits to book. “Please spare Bodh Gaya and do not do anything that is contrary to the teachings of Buddha,” appealed the CM.The CM also laid the foundation stone of a Rs 145 crore cultural-cum-convention centre which will come up on a 10 acre plot in Bodh Gaya. The convention centre will accommodate 2,000 people. There will be six smaller auditoriums with 500 capacity each and a dining hall to accommodate 1000 people. “The centre will be operational within the next two years,” said Nitish.Earlier, deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi requested the CM to take the initiative to get Bodh Gaya included in the proposed development of 10 iconic tourist cities as per the budgetary announcement made by finance minister Arun JaitelyCultural troupes from Sri Lanka, Thailand, Myanmar, Laos and Vietnam, besides national, state and local artists would be performing at the decorated event venue. Dharamshala (HP)-based Tibetan artists are also in Bodh Gaya to perform at the event.Speaking on the occasion, former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi demanded the establishment of Bodh Gaya Development Authority and an alternative approach route for Muclind Sarovar located on the shrine premises.

       " 'Pt Vishwa Mohan Bhatt is fascinated with the Padmaavat song, Ghoomar. “Aesthetically and artistically, it is so beautiful. Everyone appreciated it, even abroad. In my concerts, people request, ‘Thoda Ghoomar bajaiye’,” Panditji told us, on the sidelines of Ek Mulakat. Overwhelmed by the making of the song, Panditji, who hails from Jaipur, wants the state government to make the film tax free. “I am from Rajasthan and I am aware of the state’s cultural heritage. If Assam or Odisha were shown with such grandeur, I am sure they would have made it tax free,” said Panditji.But protests are still on to stop the screening of the film. “The film has released and I am sure representatives of Karni Sena have watched it. Now I demand they take a side. The ball is in their court. Either they should point out how the film has hurt their sentiments or they should say that they are okay with the content. Ek clear decision ana chahiye. As per the report, there is nothing to offend. Unke aan baan shaan ko kuch aanch nahi aya. Now, if Karni Sena is okay with the film, my demand stands. I want the state to make it tax free. Humara Rajasthan ka bhi to kuch farz hai ki hum unko de. Bollywoodwale ko bhi kya padi hai ke woh Rajasthan ko itni khubsoorti se dikhayega?” Panditji questioned.He also said that he has full faith in Sanjay Leela Bhansali. “He is an artiste and a mature one. He is not an irresponsible person. He is sensible, I know him well. He will never hurt anyone’s sentiment.”',\n",
       " 'With two couches, a centre table and a vase, the stage was all set to welcome music maestro Pt Vishwa Mohan Bhatt for the seventh edition of Ek Mulakat — an initiative by Prabha Khaitan Foundation, in association with Shree Cement, Tollygunge Club and Calcutta Times. But when Panditji arrived, he had something else in mind. On his request, the table and the chairs were removed and a carpet laid out. He sat crossed-legged with his instrument, the Mohan Veena, as long-time acquaintance and tabla wizard Bickram Ghosh started the conversation and took him through the different phases of his life.“When I was very young — 15 perhaps — a beautiful German woman came to visit us with her guitar. Till then, I had a smaller version of the guitar. But when she walked in, I was like, ‘Wow’. I thought I’d Indianise her,” said Panditji jokingly, to which Bickram replied, “But you Indianised her guitar instead!” The members of the audience broke into laughter at this exchange.While talking about his Kolkata connection, Panditji expressed his gratitude to Bhabasindhu Biswas, the man who helped him making his Mohan Veena.Apart the intense and colourful discussion about his musical journey, Panditji swept the audience off their feet with two short, impromptu performances. Bickram, who wasn’t carrying his tabla, played the tambourine with Panditji for a fascinating duet. “I have heard him playing live, but in a bigger space. This intimate performance is so enriching,” said composer Prabuddha Banerjee. “Bickramda conducted the talk wonderfully,” added Cactus frontman Sidhu.',\n",

       " \"When this Russian duo — Anna Filatova and Alexei Filatov — came to Chennai for a gig recently, what everyone expected was a good concert, featuring Russian songs. But the audience were surprised when they performed a Tamil song. But that isn’t at all. What’s even more surprising is that Anna speaks Tamil and duo has a special liking for all things Tamil. Excerpts from a chat with Anna.This visit to Chennai...This time, it was a one-day visit to Chennai. We came to give a concert at Unwind Center in Adyar and to meet our Tamil friends. Then, we joined another group led by professor Alexander Dubiansky, a Tamil scholar from Russia. I learnt Tamil from him. As a group, we are visiting some culturally interesting places like Tiruvannamalai, Tanjavur, Madurai and Rameshvaram, to name a few.Interest in Tamil languageI studied Tamil for six years at the Institute of Asia and Africa Studies in Moscow. I read and write Tamil. It is impossible to learn any language without reading and writing. I am familiar with pure Tamil. But colloquial language is still hard for me. It is different. I think, I should live here at least for couple of years to master colloquial Tamil. For me, it is much better and easier to speak classical Tamil, though it may seem strange to some people. I think, it’s beautiful and musical. I feel sorry that our regional languages are getting mixed more and more with English. My husband, Alexei, is also interested in Indian culture, but he doesn’t know Tamil.Love for Tamil musicWe’ve tried out couple of Tamil songs. In fact, we sang one song — Arunachala — during the concert. It’s our favourite place in Tamil Nadu (Arunachala refers to Tiruvannamalai). Generally, Indian music is very specific, mostly based on raga system. I don’t have a deep understanding of it, but it is wonderful to know how each raga flows and how the melody develops.In love with everything TamilDuring our visits, we’ve visited several places in Chennai, including Kapaleeswarar kovil and Theosophical Society And food — we both like dosai. I also like lemon rice. Sometimes, we make it at home.Russian music in ChennaiWe have given only two concerts in Chennai so far. We both try to make it interesting and sing about love, nature and beauty, which are close to everyone’s hearts, irrespective of nationalities. I am sure people here enjoy our music as we see happiness on their faces.Playing Indian flute...For the concert, I tried two types of bansuri flutes. One of them is made specially for sivaranjani raga. But I play them in my own style, not in Indian classical raga. Most of my flute compositions are in sync with the guitar melody Alexei plays. Of course, it took some time to manage with Indian flutes. I wish that one day I play Indian ragas on flute.Dressing up the Indian wayI wore sari for this concert because I thought it would be the best chance to flaunt the Indianness in me. I have five saris at home, all are gifts from our friends. I myself made Alexei's clothes after returning from our first trip to India. I am fond of different Indian clothes for its beauty. Sometimes, I even wear it in Russia.\",\n",

Watch the scenery turn a bright shade as they almost do a ballet as they flock about and feed on algae and other crustaceans here. Says bird watcher and animal rights activist Sunish Subramanian, “This is the time for flamingos to fly into Mumbai. They have already arrived and will make this city their home for the next one-and-a-half months. The habitat and the current climate conditions are just perfect for them now. The harshness of summer seem far away.”‘They\\'ve made the city their home since the early 90s’Flamingoes are a tall, wading birds with pink or scarlet plumage and long legs and neck.Since the long-legged graceful birds make for a visual treat, several city groups organise programmes to watch them during the course of their stay. \"The bird is a protected species, so one can watch them from far,\" adds Sunish.Naturalist Sunjoy Monga has launched a campaign to save the pink bird as well as Sewri Bay. He asks,“Did you know that an estimated 15,000-20,000 flamingos come to this city every year?\" He goes on to reveal more on the pink visitors, \"Mumbai is their biggest feeding grounds, out of Gujarat (where most flamingos originally come from). These are habitat-specific birds. They made the city their home in the early 1990s and have been making their annual visit since. They used to come here by October, but have started arriving later now. They are also shy and keep a respectable distance; they come close to the land when there are tidal currents. We get two species here - the lesser flamingo (smaller in size) and the greater one (larger). The lesser one is more common one. And it’s not just flamingos, if you head out to say, the mud flats at Sewri, you get to see other waders too, such as gulls, terns and other birds.\"Flamingo calendarSeveral groups organise visits for watching and photographing flamingosThe city has been conducting Flamingo Watch programmes, wherein bird experts take groups to view the birds with binoculars.

They go deeper into the water and will been as specks as the tide goes further in, so watch for tide timings when you see them… it’s a lovely sight!”Informs Isaac Kehimkar, who takes groups to Navi Mumbai to watch these birds, “The forest department declared the Airoli-mangrove patch and the Navi Mumbai creek as a flamingo sanctuary, last August.

       " \"NEW DELHI: With all the buzz around bitcoin, did the Budget just do a buzzkill? Enthusiasts of cryptocurrency in India have come up with different interpretations of the finance minister’s Budget speech, with some claiming that it had been declared illegal.What the FM actually said was that the government did not consider “cryptocurrencies legal tender or coin and will take all measures to eliminate use of these crypto assets in financing illegitimate activities or as part of the payment system”.For the uninitiated, cryptocurrency is a digital currency where encryption techniques are used to regulate the generation of units of currency and verify the transfer of funds, operating independently of a central bank.Read full text of Arun Jaitley's Budget speechNischint Sanghavi, head of exchange at Zebpay, which is a bitcoin exchange, points out that the speech simply reiterated the RBI’s stand that cryptocurrency is not recognised as legal tender in India. “This is being misreported as bitcoin is illegal. This is not true,” said Sanghavi, adding that bitcoin exchanges in India adopted the highest standards of KYC with transactions that are transparent and via bank accounts.Richie Sancheti, partner with the law firm of Nishith Desai Associates, said a case-to-case view may need to be taken on whether income from virtual currency is treated as “capital gains” or “profits and gains of business” keeping in mind the facts and circumstances of each transaction. “In any case, given the level of scrutiny for tax compliance, it is advisable to ensure that inventory of cryptocurrency held is valued accurately and all taxes paid as and when due,” added Sancheti. If the bitcoins are held for regular trading and the transactions are substantial and frequent, the net profits on sale of bitcoins would be business income.With high interest from investors, cryptocash is already under the tax lens. Last month, the I-T department sent notices to those transacting in cryptocurrency. Clarity was expected in this budget, but now there are fears of more litigation.Jaitley, however, made it clear that the government is not against blockchain, the technology that underpins cryptocurrencies. “The government will explore use of blockchain technology proactively for ushering in the digital economy,” he said.The Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Committee of India (BACC) — a lobby grouping of cryptocurrency exchanges operating in India —welcomed Jaitley’s remarks, viewing them as a possibility of government regulation in the future to check illicit activity.\",\n",

The flip side: their compulsory savings will come down.Also, the government will contribute 12% of wages of new employees in EPF for all sectors for the next three years, Arun Jaitley said.The move is aimed at boosting job creation.Currently, an employee contributes 12% of his/her basic salary as the statutory monthly contribution to EPF and a matching contribution is made by the employer.With the existing contribution of 1.16% towards EPFO subscribers’ basic wages, the government bears an annual burden of around Rs 6,750 crore.The current 8.65% interest rate on EPF deposits was lowered during the last fiscal, from 8.8% in 2015-16.

       " 'NEW DELHI: The Union Budget on Thursday announced a special scheme to subsidise machinery required by farmers in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to deal with crop residue in the belief that this would help curb stubble burning, a factor in pollution in the National Capital Region. But agriculture and environmental experts, besides the farmers, believe that the measure does not deal with the root of the crop residue problem.There is no scientific estimate of how much stubble burning contributes to air pollution, but paddy stubble burning has been linked to a major spike in PM 2.5 levels in NCR in October-November and wheat stubble burning to another spike around April.The allocation for sub-mission on agriculture mechanisation was increased from Rs 525 crore in 2017-18 to Rs 1,140.29 crore, possibly to fund the machinery scheme. Under this scheme, financial assistance is provided to farm machinery testing institutes, which also impart training to farmers, technicians and nominees of state governments and agro industries and engineering entrepreneurs.The Budget was silent on other sources of air pollution such as industries and thermal power plants and there was no allocation for or a mention of the National Clean Air Programme announced last year. The allocation for the Central Pollution Control Board, responsible for enforcing and monitoring air and water pollution, was Rs 100 crore.Agricultural experts said crop stubble burning was not a problem of machinery alone. “The fact is it does not make economic sense for farmers to use labour or machinery to remove crop stubble,” said Ramanjaneyulu GV, executive director, Centre for Sustainable Agriculture. “I expected the government to focus on incentivising proper disposal of crop stubble by not burning it. It’s also not clear what will be subsidised — rotavators or happy seeders.”Ramanjaneyulu said that instead of viewing it as only a machinery problem, the government could have considered village-level composting centres. Having studied the crop stubble problem in north India, he also pointed out that there was no assistance to farmers to diversify their crop from paddy and wheat. In Andhra Pradesh, for one, before paddy is harvested, pulses are sown and the paddy stubble disintegrates naturally over time. Corroborating such a view, Umendra Dutt, farmer-leader of Punjab-based Kheti Virasat Mission, said its organic farmers never had to burn stubble nor use machinery to get rid of the crop remains stubble because their crops were diversified.Dharmendra Kumar of the Bharatiya Kisan Union felt that a “minimum support price for fruits, vegetables and others produce can go a long way in breaking the wheat-paddy cycle.”Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director at Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) said the scheme could help in dealing with episodic pollution, but “overall the Budget treated air pollution as a local problem of Delhi-NCR, ignoring the national scale of air pollution.”',\n",

Sources said these conditions might pose a hurdle in giving the traders being affected by the sealing drive the desired relief.DDA officials said parking space was essential as commercial activity would be allowed on all floors. Shop-cum-residence plots are proposed to be given the “FAR of residential plots subject to availability of parking”, according to the agenda circulated by DDA.The local bodies concerned, along with the traders’ organisations, will have to develop land for shared/common parking facilities. Otherwise, the local bodies will have to declare such areas as “pedestrian shopping streets” and the transport department will make arrangements for last-mile connectivities.Another proposal seeks to allow commercial activities in basements. This, too, will be subject to similar conditions.DDA will also consider norms for redevelopment of godown clusters in non-conforming areas and on agricultural land. Sources said most godowns were located in these areas. But in the absence of a policy for warehouses, the SC-appointed monitoring committee has been taking action in these areas. There will be two criteria for the clusters of godowns that have come up on four hectares of contiguous land or on individual plots.After its Authority decides, DDA will invite suggestions from the public within three days.

       " \"NEW DELHI: Get set to shell out more for luxury as there’s a rise in duty on import and assembly of high-end cars and motorcycles as well as devices such as Apple’s iPhone. Televisions will also get dearer as customs duty on parts used in LCD, LED and OLED panels is set to go up.Prices of luxury cars, from companies such as Audi and Mercedes Benz, may rise by Rs 1.5 lakh to Rs 10 lakh, while also impacting models from mainline makers such as Hyundai. The latter will be increasing prices on certain models such as the Elantra sedan and the Creta SUV.Jaitley increased the duty on cars that are assembled in the country (through the completely knocked down kits) from 10% to 15%.Also, the FM slapped a Social Welfare Surcharge on imported products, adding an additional 10% on existing aggregate customs duties. He also raised the duty on certain parts and accessories used in the cars, a move that will surely impact the running cost for customers and manufacturing cost for companies.These measures are meant to push local manufacturing, though most of the companies who were impacted by the move disagreed, saying demand will be hit, limiting their capacity to hire more and put in new investments.The price hikes will come into force almost immediately and companies rued that this will have a very negative impact on demand, which is already under pressure after the government placed luxury vehicles in one of the top rate categories in the GST.Audi’s A3 entry sedan will now be costing Rs 1.5 lakh more, while the competing CLA mid-size from Mercedes gets dearer by Rs 1.2 lakh. The S-Class saloon from Mercedes will see an increase of Rs 5 lakh while the Audi’s R8 sports car will be expensive by as much as Rs 10 lakh.“The budget is very disappointing, and will impact our ability to create more jobs in India as well as boost our investments,” Rahil Ansari, the Head of Audi’s local subsidiary told TOI.Roland Folger, the MD of Mercedes Benz in India, called the budget’s proposals as “unfortunate” and said it will hit demand for luxury cars. “It is against the spirit of ‘Make in India’… we are left with no option but to pass on the resulting increase in price to the customers.”And not only are the luxury players impacted, volume-grossers such as Hyundai also complained of pressure. “We will be increasing prices across our product range, some due to higher costs of imported parts and the rest due to the customs hike on CKD cars,” Rakesh Srivastava, Director at Hyundai India said.Aspirational bike-makers also need to pay more customs duty and now fear that demand will be hit. “This is an unnecessary penalty on us and the consumers, and prices will need to be hiked by 5-5.5%,” Vimal Sumbly, MD of Triumph, said.Sunil Vachani, MD of contract manufacturer Dixon Technologies who makes TVs, phones and other electronics products, also criticised the move. “The decision to increase the duty on parts for TV panels is very retrograde. It will lead to a hike in prices and will not only impact consumer demand, but also limit our ability to expand more and create jobs. We are losing an opportunity.”Manish Sharma, president of Consumer Electronics and Appliances Manufacturers Association, agreed. “While we are fundamentally in line with the approach of a phased manufacturing program in televisions, but the government needs to consult the industry before taking decisions that carry a large impact on business and consumer prices.”WATCHWatch: what's cheaper and costlier post budget 2018\",\n",

For instance, Asics Gel 360 shoes when imported into India, which currently cost Rs 15,999 may now cost Rs 17,120, according to EY.Top sportswear brands are betting on the ASEAN-India Free Trade Area (AIFTA) treaty, which allows goods from 10 countries, including Vietnam and Cambodia to be imported into India with minimal customs duty. “After China, Vietnam is the hub for top-end sports shoe manufacturing,” said an Indian shoe manufacturer and retailer.

       " 'NEW DELHI: A significant increase in healthcare facilities, particularly in smaller towns and villages, is expected with the launch of the National Health Protection Scheme (NHPS).Insurers also say that they will have more bargaining power in controlling costs of procedures and the scheme could lead to innovations in health insurance as this brings under its umbrella 40% of India’s population.The NHPS envisages a cover of Rs 5 lakh for poor and vulnerable families for secondary and tertiary care hospitalisation. The NHPS will replace the Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana (RSBY), which provides an annual coverage of Rs 30,000. The Rs 5-lakh cover actually is an upgrade of the Rs 1-lakh coverage announced by the FM in 2016 Budget.It is not yet clear how the government will fund a scheme which is expected to cost up to Rs 50,000 crore if the Rs 5-lakh cover has the same terms as existing group policies.New India Assurance chairman G Srinivasan said that on an average the premium per family could be estimated to be in the Rs 4,000-5,000 range. “This is a massive scheme covering close to 40% of the population and covers three times more people than what the current RSBY covers,” said Srinivasan.According to Digit Insurance chairman Kamesh Goyal, the advantage of group insurance for consumers will be the absence of exclusions. “In group covers, complaints are lower because claims are not rejected for pre-existing conditions. The challenge is that as people are growing older, premium goes up dramatically,” said Goyal.Insurers say that even under the old RSBY scheme, there has been an increase in the number of smaller healthcare facilities across the country. A sum insured of Rs 5 lakh would cover most of the tertiary care procedures.While insurance companies are bullish on an insurance-backed healthcare plan, there are some who feel that the spending should be through public healthcare. “Universal health insurance through private hospitals has not worked for poor anywhere.Biggest beneficiaries are the private hospitals and insurance companies. There is no substitute for public healthcare,” former finance secretary Arvind Mayaram said on a micro-blogging site.WATCHNational Health Protection Schemes to cover 10 crore poor families: FM',\n",

Unlikely, says Darshan Patel, founder & CEO, Vini Cosmetics, the maker of Fogg deodorants.“There will not be any price change as we make everything in India.

TOI was the first to report on Thursday that police had busted a gang of detectives and arrested four of them for illegally sourcing and selling CDRs.Pandit (54), the daughter of a former police officer, was picked up from her Dadar home after an arrested detective, Samresh Jha, told police he had sourced CDRs on her instructions and delivered it to her for a hefty price. A police officer said there was strong evidence to show that Pandit had demanded and bought CDRs of at least five people. Apart from her, two others were arrested on Friday.Thane police chief Param Bir Singh said, “Pandit’s role has been clearly established. Those involved in the scam will not be spared.”Apart from Pandit, police on Friday arrested two other detectives—Santosh Pandgale (34) and Prashant Sonawane (34)—from Navi Mumbai, taking the number of arrests to six. Four detectives—Makesh Pandian, Prashant Palekar (49), Jigar Makwana (35) and Samresh Jha (32) aka Pratik Mohpal—were arrested on Thursday.“During questioning, it came to light that Pandit had procured five CDRs from Jha. Her statement has been recorded and we are questioning her for any leads in the racket which seems to be much bigger,” DCP (crime) Abhishek Trimukhe said. Police officials said more arrests were likely in the coming days as they had found that most detectives brazenly promise CDRs to their clients for a premium. They added that the arrests may just be the tip of the iceberg. “The probe is in the right direction and forensic analysis of the material seized from the accused may expose the dark trade,” an officer said.Police have also zeroed in on a Delhi man who was reportedly providing CDRs to the accused. “A team will soon be dispatched to Delhi to nab him as he seems to be a key member of the racket,” said senior inspector Nitin Thakre.Meanwhile, police have started technical analysis of the CDRs seized.

       " 'MUMBAI: The BMC has increased its budget by 8% this year, mainly to kickstart a slew of infrastructure projects, but it has left municipal taxes unchanged, opting to dip into its own reserves for the first time for the city’s development.The commissioner of the country’s richest civic body, Ajoy Mehta, presented a budget of Rs 27,258 crore for Mumbai for the financial year 2018-19 on Friday, projecting an increase of more than Rs 2,000 crore over 2017-18, but still short of the Rs 37,000 crore figure announced the year before.Among key initiatives mentioned in the proposals are a 39-km cycling track along the Tansa water mains, floating barriers to keep garbage out of the city’s rivers and streams, and a public-private partnership model for civic schools.Underscoring the need to improve BMC’s financial health, the commissioner expressed concern over the drop in revenue from various sources including property tax. To meet expenses, the civic body now plans to withdraw Rs 2,744 crore from its fixed deposits of Rs 69,135 crore.“Revenue income has become primarily dependent on the growth of the real estate sector. Therefore from the next financial year we will have to resort to withdrawal from special reserves funds created from time to time,” said the civic body chief.To augment revenue, Mehta has also proposed a revision of charges for factory permits, license fees for wholesale markets and fees for treatment at civic hospitals. He said such measures were necessary as spending on basic civic services had increased.As usual, a sizeable chunk of the expenditure in the coming year is earmarked for roads and storm water drains—total allocation for public works is Rs 9,522 crore, of which the Coastal Road gets Rs 1,500 crore and the Goregaon-Mulund Link Road (GMLR) Rs 100 crore although environmental clearance for GMLR seems unlikely anytime soon.In all, the allocation for the roads department has increased to Rs 1,202 crore from Rs 1079 crore last year, and for storm water drains, it is Rs 566 crore, up from Rs 446 crore last year.“As far as roads and storm water drains are concerned, as compared to allocations made last year, more funds are being sought,” said Mehta.Another area of focus is flooding: 146 vulnerable spots were identified during the torrential downpour on August 29 last year. The BMC plans to deal with 55 of them before the coming monsoon. In a first, a special allocation of Rs 54 crore has been made to control flooding.Another interesting initiative is an allocation of Rs 100 crore for a cycling and jogging track parallel to the Tansa water pipeline to create an alternative mode of transport. The track will connect several railway, metro and monorail stations.Reacting to the overall plan, Shiv Sena leader in the BMC Yashwant Jadhav expressed satisfaction at the budget. “Many of the proposals are for the benefit of the public,” he said.Samajwadi Party leader in the BMC Rais Shaikh said it was good in spirit, “but while focusing on implementation, one shouldn’t run out of creativity and not propose anything new”. “Though no new taxes have been proposed, the corporation has a blanket approval for increasing various charges every year,” he said.',\n",

Their dreams have been shattered,” he said.The counsel for the youths, Pardeep Rapria, on Monday had said the fresh chargesheet proved the innocence of these four youths arrested by the SIT. “It has also exposed how unreliable the police can be when it comes to investigating grave crimes amidst a public outcry and close media scrutiny,” Rapria had said.On the intervening night of August 24 and 25, 2016, a family in Dingerheri was attacked.

It was mentioned in the report that expired anti-snake venom serums seized in Patna were supplied only to Gujarat from where the consignment had landed in Patna after their expiry.The expired serums and other fake and expired drugs were recovered the in state capital on May 27 last year. The serums, each costing Rs 600, were re-stamped with Rs 1,500 and their expiry dates were also changed.The court also sought an action taken report from the DIG on cases lodged in connection with recovery of expired or fake medicines across the state.On January 19, the high court had wanted to know from the state government why the probe into medicine scam should not be handed over to CBI. Chief Justice Menon had asked the record section of the high court to hand over all documents related to the scam to CBI for preliminary study.On Thursday, advocate general Lalit Kishore, while appearing for the state, informed the court that four special investigation teams – two each under city SP (east) and city SP (central) – were formed to probe the medicine scam. However, the court, which was not satisfied with the reply, sought a counter affidavit from the government.Kishore said drug inspector Sachchidanand Prasad, who had unearthed the scam, was not transferred, but instead given additional charge of one more post in Bihar Drug Control Laboratory (BDCL). It was brought to the notice of the court during the last hearing that Prasad was transferred by the health department. The court had sought a reply from the health department on the issue.',\n",

       " 'PATNA: Contrary to high expectations from the “double engine” NDA governments at the Centre and in state, no big-ticket announcement was made for Bihar in the general Budget for fiscal 2018-19 presented by Union finance minister Arun Jaitley on Thursday. The state had to console itself with only a few “smaller” schemes of various central ministries.Piped gas supply in Patna, two new rail lines (Biharsharif-Barbigha and Biharsharif-Daniawan), development of Indo-Nepal border road, setting up of a science city and funds for construction of new terminal building at Patna airport were some of the takeaways for the state from the Union Budget.Experts said Bihar would also benefit from announcements like raising the minimum support price in agriculture sector up to 1.5 times of the input cost and expansion of free cooking gas programme to 8 crore poor families from 5 crore earlier. Nearly 65% of the population of Bihar lives below poverty line (BPL) and around 70% people are dependent on agriculture.Nonetheless, the Budget has iterated the commitment of Narendra Modi government to commence supply of piped natural gas (PNG) in Bihar from Jagdishpur-Haldia/Bokaro-Dhamra Natural Gas Pipeline of state- run Gail India Ltd in 2018.The Budget provisions related to ministry of petroleum and natural gas include construction of gas trunk or main pipelines measuring 400 km connecting Patna, Varanasi, Ranchi, Jamshedpur, Cuttack and Bhubaneswar. Union minister of petroleum and natural gas Dharmendra Pradhan had said on October 6 last year that work on 204km of main town gas supply network in Bihar under Gail’s Jagdishpur-Haldia pipeline would be completed by October this year.In terms of railways, Budget provisions have been made for construction of Biharsharif-Barbigha (25.8km) and Biharsharif-Daniawan (38km) new rail lines out of 1,000km rail lines to be constructed across the country in 2018-19 utilising funds to the tune of Rs 28,490 crore.In road sector, the Budget has talked about construction of 378.11km road along Indo- Nepal border. State road construction minister Nand Kishor Yadav told TOI that Bihar forms a major chunk of the Indo-Nepal border road. Union minister of road, transport and highways Nitin Gadkari had also said in Patna on Monday that National Highways Authority of India has been asked to prepare the detailed project report for construction of 512km of road along Indo-Nepal border under Bharatmala project.Bihar figures in new science city scheme of ministry of culture as well. The Budget has also proposed development of consumer counselling centres in Bihar and several other states by ministry of consumer affairs. The state government has already started work on Dr A P J Abdul Kalam Science City project near Moinul Haque stadium in Patna utilising funds to the tune of Rs 397 crore.Bihar is also likely to witness flow of funds from the Centre for developments in the aviation sector. The Union Budget has allocated significant funds for development of terminal at several full-fledged airports and revival of 50 airstrips under regional air- connectivity scheme. A sum of Rs 4,086 crore has been allocated for upgradation of facilities at various airports, including new terminal buildings and Rs 890 crore for revival of 50 airstrips under UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Naagrik) scheme of ministry of civil aviation.While work on construction of new terminal building at Jayaprakash Narayan International Airport, Patna, is slated to commence from April utilising funds to the tune of Rs 800 crore, IndiGo has been selected to operate flights from airbase of Indian Airforce at Darbhanga, where a new terminal is to be developed.QUOTE:“The Budget, it seems, has been presented with an eye on upcoming elections. The government has announced several measures for agriculture sector, but they are not likely to double farmers’ income by 2022 as promised by the government earlier. Bihar seems to be almost out of the scope of this Budget as no big-ticket announcement, like special category status for the state, has been made.

       " \"PATNA: Leader of opposition in legislative Assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav on Thursday said the Union Budget presented by finance minister Aun Jaitley had nothing for Bihar.Tejashwi also took potshots at CM Nitish Kumar over his much-hyped idiom of “double engine”. “Is this the double engine Nitish talks about? It is because of him that the Centre is meting out step-motherly treatment to Bihar,” Tejashwi said.The “double engine” idiom was first used by PM Narendra Modi during the 2015 assembly polls in the state, which RJD and JD (U) had fought in alliance. Modi had said that the state must have the same party - the BJP - in power at the Centre as well as in Bihar for rapid development. The idiom has of late been repeatedly used by the young RJD leader, who was formerly Kumar's deputy, for taking potshots at the CM whose exit from Mahagathbandhan followed corruption cases against Lalu Prasad.Accusing Narendra Modi-led government of being “pro-rich”, Tejashwi said, “The BJP has done nothing at the ground so far. It only tries to sell shallow dreams and mostly serves to the interest of the rich,” Tejashwi said. He termed the announcement of hike in minimum support price for crop procurement a “farce”, claiming that market rate of the same is much lower.“Budget is an illusory for farmers. The MSP for paddy is Rs 1,600 per quintal, but no one purchases it at that cost in the market. Consequently, the farmers are forced to sell it at Rs 1,300 per quintal. How can the Modi government think of farmers getting buyers at even higher MSP?” Tejashwi asked.The former deputy CM also challenged the announcement of creation of 75 lakh jobs for youths made in the Budget speech of Jaitley. “The government has claimed that 75 lakh new jobs will be created, but it should first tell the country how many jobs it has created in the last four years,” Tejashwi said.He criticised the Centre for “ignoring” education and health sectors as well as railways.\",\n",

People of the state, especially those associated with trade and industries, were looking forward for such provisions in the Budget,” said Bihar Chamber of Commerce and Industries (BCCI) president P K Agrawal.Bihar Industries Association president K P S Keshri said they had suggested a ‘development fund’ for Bihar to boost industries in the state. “We are upset as no such allotment has been announced,” Keshri added. He, however, said the Budget was a balanced one, and not populist, as anticipated by many. “Some of the measures proposed in the Budget will strengthen the country’s economy. The government’s move to boost agriculture is a welcome step. Being an agriculture-driven state, Bihar will benefit from it if the state government takes concrete steps to implement the schemes,” Keshri said.BCCI president Agrawal said they were expecting announcement of special measures in the Budget to neutralise the effects of demonetisation, but the government did nothing to address the concerns raised by trade and industry bodies of the state. Agrawal, however, appreciated the government for putting emphasis on agriculture, health and infrastructure sectors.PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industries (PHDCCI) welcomed the government’s move to extend benefit of reduced corporate tax rate of 25% to companies which have reported turnover of up to Rs 250 crore in financial year 2016-17.However, common people did not find much relief from the Budget. City-based chartered accountant Subodh Goel said the middle class and salaried people were expecting relaxation in tax slab, which had not been announced. “Increase of education cess from 3% to 4% is a burden on common people. Sale of equity after one year was exempted from tax earlier, but now 10% tax will be charged on it,” he said.Executive director of centre for health policy, Asian Development Research Institute, Basudeb Guha Khasnobis, welcomed the provision of insurance coverage of Rs 5 lakh per family per annum for indoor hospitalisation of the poor. He, however, said middle class people should also have been included in the scheme.',\n",

The container, after being docked at Haldia port in Kolkata, was on way to Kathmandu via road when it was seized by police at Kashichak in Nawada district for violation of prohibition laws on May 2 last year. Truck driver Dilip Sharma was arrested and police sought permission for destruction of the consignment. The firm then moved the court to get the consignment released.While lawyers like Y V Giri, Nikhil Kumar Agrawal and Aditi Hansaria were representing the firm, the state was represented by advocate general Lalit Kishore.“The court has asked police to take the truck with the consignment to the Indo-Nepal border and hand it over to the firm authorities in two weeks. The vehicle will return to Nawada and a decision to release it will be taken later,” Agrawal said, adding the Nepalese firm had to furnish a bank guarantee of Rs 8 lakh before the district magistrate of Nawada.Earlier on January 16, the bench had ordered the government to send a police team to Kathmandu to verify the firm’s background before taking any decision on releasing the consignment.',\n",

       " 'NEW DELHI: More than 13 years after it was abolished, longterm capital gains (LTCG) tax made a comeback on Dalal Street but market players feel that its impact on stocks would be limited.On Thursday, the government proposed to tax LTCG of above Rs 1 lakh per annum at 10%, compared to the earlier rate of 20% after indexation when it was abolished in October 2004. Indexation is a process that neutralises the impact of inflation on profits.In the run-up to the Budget, there were fears that the market could slide sharply if the LTCG tax was introduced. That proved to be unfounded. After falling initially, it recovered to close marginally down. But a new dilemma has arisen for those investing in the stock markets.How do you compute it? LTCG exceeding Rs 1 lakh will be taxed at 10% on sale of shares on and after April 1, 2018. Further, no indexation benefit (which is the increase in the purchase price to factor in the inflation) is available. Indexation had resulted in reducing the quantum of the capital gains.However, appreciation in the value of shares from the date of purchase — up to January 31, 2018 — will be grandfathered if such shares were acquired before February 1, 2018.Let us see how this works.Mr A had purchased 1,000 shares of XYZ Limited at Rs 250 per share in January 2015. Let us assume that he now sells these shares in November 2018 at Rs 600 per share. Had he sold the shares before March 31, 2018, the entire long-term capital gains arising on such a sale would have been exempt. If shares are sold after March 31, there will be a tax on the resultant long-term capital gains.Typically, capital gains refers to the difference between the sale price (Rs 600) minus the purchase price, also referred to as the cost of acquisition. In Mr A’s case, without indexation benefit, this is Rs 250, resulting in a capital gain of Rs 350 (Rs 600 minus Rs 250) per share.However, Mr A will get the benefit of the grandfathering clause (i.e. the benefit of appreciation in the value of the shares from the date of purchase up to January 31, 2018).In other words, the ‘deemed’ cost of acquisition of his shares could work out to be much more than the actual purchase price, resulting in a reduced long-term capital gains and thus a lower tax outgo.According to the Finance Bill, the deemed cost of acquisition will be the sale price (Rs 600) or the fair market value as on January 31, 2018 (say Rs 300) whichever is lower. Here, the cost will be Rs 300.In Mr A’s case, the actual cost of acquisition is Rs 250. So he can adopt the higher deemed cost of Rs 300. By adopting this higher value of Rs 300, his long-term capital gains will be lower and will result in a reduced outgo of tax.',\n",
       " 'NEW DELHI: The sensex and Nifty recovered smartly on Thursday by over 350 points from their intra-session lows that dealers said was a knee-jerk reaction to the government’s move to reintroduce LTCG tax.The exemption clause for LTCG, that rendered all such profits till January 31, 2018 as tax-neutral, helped the recovery and the sensex closed at 35,907 points — down 58 points, or just 0.2%.Market players, however, were disappointed by the fact that although LTCG made a comeback, Securities Tranaction Tax (STT) — a levy that had replaced LTCG in 2004 — continued, making India probably the only country in the world to have both the levies at the same time.“The real disappointment was the continuation of STT along with LTCG. Logically, only one should be there,” said Religare Broking president Jayant Manglik. The day’s slide was led by stocks like ONGC, while M&M, L&T & RIL gained.The session also witnessed a large number of consumer goods and auto stocks rallying as the. Axis Capital MD Dharmesh Mehta said, “It’s a pro-rural, growth-oriented Budget which can boost domestic consumption in a significant way.”Equity on par with debt MFs after taxThe reintroduction of LTCG on dividends paid by equity MFs at 10% without indexation benefits is expected to bring investments in these schemes nearly on a par with debt funds, which pay LTCG tax at 20% after indexation.However, the grandfathering clause is welcome. “The extent of impact is low on funds since there’s a non-disruptive mechanism in the changed laws,” said UTI MF group president & head (equity) Vetri Subramaniam.However, most fund managers believe the FM should have abolished STT.',\n",
       " 'NEW DELHI: The reduction in income tax rate from 30% to 25% for companies with a turnover of up to Rs 250 crore is a mixed bag for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) as the cut is coupled with an increase in health and education cess.MSMEs with a turnover of up to Rs 50 crore will have to shell out more in taxes, while firms with a revenue of more than Rs 50 crore but up to Rs 250 crore will have to pay less.Budget 2018 has raised health and education cess from 3% to 4%, making companies up to a Rs 50-crore turnover worse off.The applicable tax rate for a Rs 50-crore turnover entity will rise to 29.12% next fiscal from the current 28.84% (including a 3% cess), which will definitely pinch. However, companies with a turnover of Rs 50-250 crore will benefit as they will now pay a tax of 29.12% instead of 34.61%.Finance minister Arun Jaitley said, “As far as businesses are concerned, I have not forgotten them either, which is a very strong part of the middle class. So all businesses and companies with up to Rs 250-crore turnover uniformly pay 5% less tax. So they have a lot more investible surplus.”Abhishek Goenka, partner and direct tax leader at PwC India, said, “The reduction is welcome since it enables reasonably large companies also to get the benefit of the reduced rate.However, creating tax arbitrages drives behaviour to minimise taxes by moving activities into the eligible companies, and that is best avoided. An across-theboard reduction should have been considered instead.”Mahavir Lunawat, founder of Pantomath Group, which offers MSME advisory services, said, “After GST, smaller businesses had to transform their business models. The cut in corporate tax rate will further incentivise them to streamline their businesses.”Sudhir Kapadia, partner and national tax leader at EY India, said, “Though 99% of companies will fall under the 25% tax rate, the balance 1% actually contribute a disproportionately large share to the economy by way of turnover and taxes, both direct and indirect.”',\n",
       " \"The highlight of Budget 2018-19 is the assurance to farmers that they would get, for all crops, a minimum support price that is 50% higher than cost of production.This will apparently deliver a big benefit to farmers. Besides, farmer producer organisations have been exempted from direct taxes. Farmer organisations across the nation had agitated against their stressed conditions, particularly after demonetisation. The Gujarat elections revealed the political implications of their angst.Agriculture is a risky business — far riskier than industry. Twice every year farmers initially face a production risk and then a price risk. They need risk-mitigation instruments, modernisation, better logistics to integrate with consumers and more.An assured 50% return on cost does not help in any of these directions. It probably eliminates the risk of losses, but its collateral damage will be to ruin agricultural markets that discover prices.While the assurance to farmers has overtones of political expediency, its economic outcomes can be interesting in the short run if the government delivers a handsome increase in income to farmers. The increase, however, is not very clear as it depends upon the method of calculation.If, and it's a big if, the intention of the government is to make big transfers to the farmers for political gains, then corporates can expect good demand growth from the rural sector during 2018-19.If monies reach the farmers in time, the multiplier effects could play an effective role in triggering a revival. A half-hearted or delayed implementation would render the scheme ineffective. It will then be seen as a mere election-winning slogan or a jumla.The Budget, in general, is somewhat expansionary. The 13.8% increase in central government expenditure (Budget estimate, or BE, over BE) after a 15% (revised estimate, or RE) growth in the current year will help in expanding aggregate demand, which is the need of the day.A more aggressive growth of, say 20%, could be a much better antidote to the sluggish economy.During the first three years of Modi sarkar, expenditure grew at single-digit rates, averaging over 7% a year. In comparison, the average growth during 2004-05 through 2013-14 was 13.5% per annum with a peak of 24.5% during 2008-09.Almost all discussions regarding GST have been around its implementation and rates. But its benefit is in a fall in the effective tax incidence.GST removes the cascading impact of indirect taxes. Its introduction is supposed to reduce the final indirect taxes we pay. Budget 2018-19 does not show any such impact. The tax/GDP incidence is expected to rise from 11.2% in 2016-17 to 11.4% in 2017-18 and to 12.1% in 2018-19. From an aggregate demand perspective, this ratio has to decline. Compliance is a different story.\",\n",

The government should allow every university – government or private – to become world-class,” said Saxena.He said that considering its the last NDA government’s budget before the general elections, the allocation has been hugely disappointing. “We expected it to be much more,” he said. Though the government has acknowledged the need for investment in research, the allocation for Department of Science and Technology was not substantial. The government has also not considered waiving off GST on several education-related services that has been in demand for some time, added Saxena.IIT-Bombay director Devang Khakhar said the institute was likely to benefit from huge funding set aside for infrastructure. “Students from premier institutes like ours will also benefit from fellowships announced for pursuing PhD at IITs,” said Khakhar. The PM research fellowship aims to address the shortage of faculty in premier institutes too.Former vice-chancellor of Mumbai University, Rajan Welukar, said the budget outlay for education should have ideally been 6% of the total, which was not achieved even this year. “The government should have also invested in teacher training institutes,” he added.',\n",

He said to double the income of farmers, as promised, agri growth will have to touch 12% which was not possible.

       " 'MUMBAI: The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) budget for 2018-19, to be presented on Friday, is unlikely to spring any surprises, said civic sources. They expect allocation for road and stormwater drain departments to witness a marginal rise.This is municipal chief Ajoy Mehta’s third budget since he took charge in April 2015; it could also be his last one.Citizens and activists hope the BMC allocates funds judiciously and utilizes them completely, especially for crucial departments like roads. “We expect BMC to propose new technologies for road repairs so that they last longer. Currently, the lifespan of most roads in the city is a few years,” said activist GR Vora said.BMC is the richest civic body in the country. It’s budget size in 2017-18 was Rs 25,141 crore—it had witnessed a drop of almost Rs 10,000 crore as the 2016-17 budget was Rs 37,052 crore.In the current fiscal year, BMC’s earnings have taken a major hit from almost revenue-generating sources. On January 30, TOI had reported on how the BMC is struggling to meet its target for property tax collection this fiscal. Now, it seems the Development Plan (DP) department may not meet its target too.Owing to the slack in the real estate market, coupled with the high court ban on construction on vacant plots, BMC has earned Rs 3,112 crore so far from the DP department. The target for in 2017-18 is Rs 4,964 crore. A senior civic official said, “The DP department earns revenue through building permissions issued, premiums, penalties or FSI. With the revenue being at an all-time low this year, we have now revised the target to Rs 3,576 crore.” In fact, going by available data, revenue from DP department seems to be heading south—in 2014-15, it was Rs 5,171 crore, in 2015-16, Rs 4,977 crore and in 2016-17, Rs 4,339 crore.Till last week, property tax collected in 2017-18 was Rs 3,320 crore—the target is Rs 5,200 crore.

       " 'MUMBAI: Colaba’s Koyla rooftop restaurant has a conditional no-objection certificate (NOC) from the fire department allowing the use of electric appliances to warm food, similar to 1Above, the illegal rooftop resto-bar at Kamala Mills compound where a fire had claimed 14 lives on December 29.This shocking fact came to fore when civic officials on Thursday demolished the illegal eatery operating from the terrace of Kamal Mansion and sealed the premises for several violations, including illegal construction. Koyla also operates from one of the floors of the Colaba building, with required permissions. Koyla is owned by Farhan Azmi, son of SP legislator Abu Azmi.Civic officials pointed out that it is surprising that the chief fire officer would issue the conditional NOC allowing the use of electric appliances—grill toasters, sandwich makers and microwave oven—on the terrace to keep food warm, when Koyla has no permission to use the terrace for serving food. A week before the Kamala Mills incident, fire officer Rajendra Patil had visited 1Above and given a similar conditional NOC to regularize the illegal rooftop resto-bar. Patil was later arrested.A civic officer claimed that instead of electric appliances, the Koyla management was using gas cylinder to cook food, hence it was served a notice on January 30.The BMC claimed that it had first inspected Koyla on December 30, a day after the Kamala Mills blaze, after receiving complaints that the restuarant was running illegally on the terrace as well as serving hookah. It conducted another inspection on January 15 around 5pm, when no hookah and cooking activities could be seen. But sources pointed out that these activities do not start till late evening.The BMC acted against the irregularities at Koyla on Thursday only after public outcry. Assistant municipal commissioner Kiran Dighavkar said, “On Thursday, we demolished the permanent structures on the terrace and seized hookahs as the management did not pay heed to our January 30 notice. Besides, Koyla has permission to operate the restaurant on the lower floor, not the terrace.”But Farhan said he will take the BMC to court over the issue. “We have all our licences in place and had also applied for permission for service in the rooftop area under the new policy. We have been operating here for the last 17 years and there has never been a problem so far. The BMC cannot shut us down as we have not broken any law.”',\n",

       " 'NEW DELHI: Congress dubbed the Budget a “big let down” and “defeatist” as it accused the government of throwing in the towel instead of making belated efforts to solve problems while the Left said initiatives for the poor were an acknowledgment of deteriorating ground realities.Congress president Rahul Gandhi tweeted, “4 years gone; still promising farmers a fair price. 4 years gone; fancy schemes, with no matching budgets. 4 years gone; no jobs for our youth. Thankfully, only one more year to go.” And former finance minister P Chidambaram said the government failed to boost exports, agriculture, healthcare, jobs, investment and provide tax relief.At the same time, Congress which had pushed entitlement programmes like rural job guarantee and food security, will have reasons to be wary of the potential appeal of the ambitious health insurance and farm price support programmes.Regional opposition parties were also critical with BJD leader Bhartruhari Mahtab saying the emphasis on direct intervention in 115 districts was an infringement of the authority of the states. He said health insurance was a welcome step but much will depend on implementation.BSP supremo Mayawati also dubbed the Budget presented as anti-poor and pro-capitalists. She claimed the government showed little concern for the poor, labourers, farmers and the working class as a result of which unemployment is rising and the chasm between the rich and the poor widening.“The government has run out of ideas to boost exports. The finance minister has imposed additional customs duties to restrict imports. The Prime Minister’s speech at — and the spirit of — Davos has been forgotten within a few days,” said Chidambaram.“There is nothing to indicate that farmers’ real income will rise. Farm sector distress will continue and deepen, putting in peril the lives of a majority of people primarily dependent on agriculture,” he added and said the maths of the health insurance will be staggering and unviable.CPM attributed the FM’s speech in Hindi (in parts) and the budget’s focus on agriculture to the government’s belated realisation of ground realities.Lok Sabha MP Mohammed Salim said, “The party which talks about Mahabharat and Ramayana, forgot Eklavya; social outcasts still remain where they were. The Budget has nothing for minorities, and SCs, STs and OBCs have also not been prioritised.”RJD MP Jaiprakash Narain Yadav said there is nothing in the Budget for Bihar, and that the promises made were hollow. “BJP magic is over.

The murderer ransacked the house but left most of Niruben’s jewellery intact on her person, leading the police to suspect that the robbery was staged.Balraj, who works in Churchgate, discovered Niruben’s body. He used to leave home for work around 8.30 am and returned around 6.30 pm. When he returned home, he was surprised to find the door to his house locked from outside. On opening it, he found belongings strewn around and could not find his mother. On reaching the bathroom, he found her in a pool of blood with the throat slit. The killer had left the water tap open, possibly to drown out her screams.“Balraj started screaming and neighbours rushed out of their homes. It was a horrific sight,” said a resident, adding that Niruben had lived in the area for more than 40 years. Her married daughter lives in another wing of the building.“We are questioning Balraj. We have learnt that he brought visitors home which did not go down well with his mother. We are probing if anyone who had a dispute with Balraj is involved,” said a police official. “We are not completely disregarding the robbery angle yet.”The SRA building neither has a security guard nor CCTVs. “Niruben’s gold chain was missing but her gold bangles and earrings were intact.

A team of paleontologists, including international dinosaur experts, on Thursday discovered over 70 bones of dinosaurs of Jurassic age at Kotampalli, 400km from here. Fish and tree fossils were also found in the forest area.Dr Dhananjay Mohabey, former deputy director general of Geological Survey of India (GSI), revealed the bones are over 150-160 million years old. The fossilized body parts of the dinosaurs include well preserved claw, series of vertebrae (backbone) and broken limb bones like femur, humerus, tibia and radiale. “Some of the parts seem to be of juvenile dinosaurs,” he added.Dr Mohabey was on a visit to Waddham and Kotampalli along with Sironcha deputy conservator Tushar Chavan and international dinosaur experts Jeffrey A Wilson, assistant professor with department of geology in University of Michigan, Gregory P Wilson, associate professor with University of Washington, palaeobotanists Dr DK Kapgate and Nusrat Sheikh.The global experts were in the city for a workshop on ‘Deccan volcanism and tracking biotic changes including dinosaurs’ on January 16. The workshop, organized by the department of geology, Nagpur University, was followed by a five-day field excursion during which experts also visited some sites in Chhindwara and Betul in MP. While other participants left, the US experts were keen to visit Sironcha.“The Pranhita-Godavari basin in Sironcha is claimed to be India’s first dino site. Maharashtra Ecotourism Development Board (MDDB) has even sanctioned Rs83 lakh to develop a fossils park in Waddham, which is just 2km away from the present discovery site Kotampalli,” said DyCF Chavan.Dr Mohabey says the discovery of the first Indian dinosaur was made by Hislop in Pisdura (Maharashtra) in 1859. Later, complete skeletons were found in 1959 from Sironcha. One skeleton of dinosaur of Jurassic age — Barapasaurs Tagori — was discovered from Kotampalli and it is kept at the Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata. Later, another skeleton of Kotasaurus Yamanpalliensis species from Yamanpalli in (Telangana) was mounted in Birla Science Museum by GSI in Hyderabad. GSI is studying the fossils since 1998.Dr Mohabey says in 2015, a visit to the Kotampalli fossils site had yielded around 60 bones of dinosaurs that were kept in the forest office at Sironcha after preliminary study. “Even the bones discovered on Thursday will be studied and scientific description will be given,” the expert said.Wilson told TOI that based on his observations, the bones seem to be of a new Sauropod dinosaur. The team also visited other important fossil sites in Waddham Jurassic plant fossil park, presently managed by the forest department.Chavan said discussions were held with the team of paleontologists for further research on the dinosaur bones, development of fossil parks and other fossils and proposed museum and interpretation centre. “The team has offered to help and assist the forest department in this great scientific venture,” he said.',\n",
       " 'Nagpur: Though the Centre has announced new health cover of Rs 5 lakh for 10 crore families in the budget, the beneficiaries in the state are likely to get an even greater coverage, if local health officials are to be believed.As per the announcement, the existing centrally sponsored health insurance scheme ‘Rashtriya Samaj Beema Yojna’ (RSBY) offers Rs 35,000 to APL, BPL and other low-income groups, will be replaced by the new national health protection scheme. In that 10 crore families will get Rs 5 lakh per year to cover secondary and tertiary hospital expenses.In 2012, state had already stopped using RSBY introducing its own health cover of Rs 1.5 lakh under the name Rajiv Gandhi Jeevandayee Arogya Yojana, which was later transformed into Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Jan Arogya Yojana (JPJAY).Nagpur district coordinator of the scheme Dr Dhiraj Wasekar said, “At present, JPJAY is also in the process of being revised. The state has given one year to a committee to make decision and formulate the policy for increasing the health cover and include packages like knee and hip replacements which were earlier not covered. The new scheme will also cover media persons having accreditation.”Now that the central government has announced a much bigger health cover than JPJAY, state is rethinking on its initial plan of revising it. Wasekar said, “I think the state will be launching its own health cover utilizing centre’s contribution going by the ratio of 7:3. It is likely the ultimate cover will be more than Rs 5 lakh.”The announcement of setting up 24 new Government Medical College (GMC) is not being taken positively by the officials of existing GMCH. A senior professor from GMCH said, “The plan is not real. Considering the condition of existing GMCs, the government should learn a lesson and take opinion of academicians and existing faculty rather than bureaucrats before form such a plan.”The professor said, “At present, GMCH here does not have sufficient faculty, due to which it is unable to have PG seats. Everybody is interested in bulk purchase irrespective of requirement. Advanced equipment is given to GMCH but there is no trained person to use it.”Reacting to the announcement of upgrading the existing district civil hospitals into GMCs, another professor said, “The state may not be in a position to execute such a plan unless the bifurcated medical education department and state public health department are combined into one, all over again.”As per Indian Medical Association (IMA), the move to open 1.5 lakh health and wellness centres is appreciable. However, meagre allocation of Rs1200 crore translates to only Rs 80,000 per centre. Still IMA promises to support this move in a PPP model.KB Tumane, nodal officer (TB) of NMC, said, “Government’s move to support TB patients with Rs 500 per month during the course of their treatment was much needed. Those patients come from poor families and this amount is meant to provide them nutritious food while they get free treatment and medication from government.”',\n",
       " 'Nagpur: An allocation of a pathetic Rs40 crore for combating climate change in the “fourth most carbon-dioxide emitting country” came as a shock for environmentalists. Amid major let-downs in the environment arena, the big boost to bamboo mission was the only silver lining in this year’s Union Budget.Air pollution did find a mention in the Budget with finance minister Arun Jaitley announcing a special scheme to tackle the issue of stubble burning in northern states neighbouring New Delhi. While this showed some hope, environmentalists feel the mention should have been more comprehensive. “Not announcing budgetary allocations for the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), which the government had committed itself last year in the Parliament, was a big disappointment,” said Sunil Dahiya, clean air campaigner at Greenpeace India.Pointing out that funds under pollution abatement field have been reduced to Rs20 crore from last year’s Rs21.20 crore, Dahiya added, “At a time when air pollution has been declared as a national crisis by the government, the allocation should have been increased manifold. The problem of pollution is not just restricted to Delhi-NCR but the entire country. The Budget focuses only on one component of pollution and fails to provide a comprehensive plan.”Stating that the Budget does not look promising on the environmental front, founder of Green Vigil Kaustav Chatterjee said: “The Budget is not in line with the Paris agreement that our country ratified. If Rs173 crore can be shelled out for national river conservation programme, why such paltry funds for air pollution and climate change which is a big concern for public health?”Much to the disappointment of wildlife buffs, the allocation for ‘Project Tiger’ was limited to Rs350 crore for providing financial assistance to 50 tiger reserves. Calling this unrealistic, president of Satpuda Foundation Kishor Rithe said, “The amount is too less for 50 reserves. Clearly, tiger conservation is not a priority for this government.”On the positive side, the allocation of Rs1,290 crore for development of bamboo production sector was a welcome move. “It is a good step but will be fruitful if accompanied by other measures like providing a market for bamboo, especially in the ecotourism sector. Right now, it is an upcoming industry and there is not much awareness about various uses of bamboo,” said Sunil Joshi, founder of Institute of Village Enterprise Development for Handicraft Artisans (VEDHA). He added that to ensure success of the bamboo mission, involvement of non-official experts is a must.',\n",
       " 'Nagpur: The Budget move to increase minimum support price (MSP) for farm produce at 50% of the cost of production has been met with a grain of doubt by farm activists. The cost of production pegged by the state government itself is higher than the MSP fixed by the Centre. So, the new MSP fixed under current standards too may not leave a 50% profit in actual terms, say activists.The MSP, which is the minimum assured rate which a farmer is supposed to get, is worked out by the Commission on Agriculture Cost and Prices (CACP), which is a central government organization. Activists here said for the state’s farmer to get enough price, the MSP will have to be more than double from the current level for a number of crops.Citing an example of cotton, the mainstay crop of the region, former MLA Wamanrao Chatap said calculations put up by the state’s four agriculture universities show the cost of production of cotton at over Rs7,240 a quintal. As against this ,the MSP stands at Rs4,320 for a quintal for the crop. Similarly, the MSP for a number of crops grown in the region like soybean, paddy and tur is less than the cost of production pegged by the state’s universities, said Chatap.“Giving a higher MSP is a mere eyewash. There is no mechanism to ensure that procurement takes place at MSP. There is no sign of any tangible allocation of funds for the MSP purchases too,” Chatap said.Farm activist Amitabh Pawde said the cost is pegged by state government as well as universities. However, the MSP is fixed by the Centre, which takes into account a much lesser figure. For cotton, if the cost of production according to the state government comes to nearly Rs7,000, by the Centre’s standards it comes to around Rs4,000.“There is no scope for any major difference even if a national average is taken. The cost of majority of inputs is same in all the states. Wages can be higher in advanced states, but that comes to only 25% of the total cost,” said Pawde.Chatap added that the CACP’s costing is nowhere close to even the national average. The cost may be slightly less in Punjab, but in majority of states it is at par with Maharashtra, he added.Vijay Ingle, a farmer from Achalpur in Amravati district who has received state government award for productivity, says actually the per quintal cost comes to be much less. Still, the current MSP is not enough for a farmer to earn a decent living. Ingle said, “The right way to calculate the cost is on per acre basis. For cotton, it comes to Rs8,000 in an acre. A farmer with irrigation facilities yields around 5 quintals in an acre. If sold at MSP, he would net in a per acre profit of Rs13,600.”“On per quintal basis, the cost comes to Rs1,600 a quintal. In percentage terms, if compared to the MSP, a farmer earns a profit of over 260% of the per quintal cost. This sounds huge but in absolute terms the money is too less. The cost of living is increasing and even a farmer has to match with the lifestyle standards,” he said.Kavita Kurunghanthi of Alliance for Sustainable and Holistic Agriculture (ASHA), said the demand is that cost of production has to be calculated under the C2 formula. This takes into account even the unpaid expenses like the imputed rental value of owned land and other capital assets. At present, it is the A2+FL formula which covers paid expenses along with family labour value. By this count, the earlier government (UPA) has already fixed MSP at a 50% margin of profit, she said.',\n",
       " 'Nagpur: Industrialists of the region are in general disappointed with the Budget. They feel that there is not much for them in this Budget and focus is on other sectors. Some rued lack of a road map to reduce non-performing assets (NPAs) that would generate a lot of employment. They hoped that boost to farm sector would lead to increase consumer spending and help industries.Vidarbha Industries Association (VIA) president Atul Pande said that most disappointing feature of the Budget was no mention of non-performing assets (NPAs) especially of SMEs. “If NPAs were addressed, they would have generated employment. Today many SMEs are functioning at less than half capacity or have closed down. Focusing on new investment is OK but existing industries should also be given attention,” he said.Pande further said that along with policy announcements, delivery commitment was necessary. “Ease of doing business should reduce our unproductive time. It does not help us if our world ranking goes up,” he added.The VIA chief welcomed impetus given to food processing industries and bamboo-based industries. “Vidarbha will definitely get a decent share of Rs1,290 crore allocated under Bamboo Mission,” he said.Butibori Manufacturers Association (BMA) president Nitin Lonkar calls the Budget not an encouraging one for industries. “The Budget mostly focuses on farm and health care sector and has not given much relief to industries. The venture capitalists have got some boost. The corporate tax exemption limit for small scale industries has been increased from Rs200 crore to Rs250 crore, which is not much. Steps have been taken to promote the textile sector. The Budget is more about ease of living than ease of doing business,” he said.Lonkar further said the personal income tax exemption limit should have been increased from Rs2.5 lakh to Rs3 lakh to boost consumer spending.MIDC Industries Association, Hingna, president Chandramohan Randhir also echoed the same feeling calling it not an industries-favoured Budget. “It was a pro-poor Budget. If farmers get more money for their produce, it will lead to increase in consumer spending and boost business and industry. However, the measures should not remain on paper. The move to increase corporate tax exemption limit is welcome. The provision of providing online loans to small and medium scale enterprises (SMEs) will make the bank officials accountable. Today we don’t get loans even after running from pillar to post,” he said.Former VIA president Pravin Tapadia termed the Budget as a routine one. “The corporate tax exemption limit has been increased, which is good but this should have been given to partnership firms too. Re-introduction of long term capital gains tax is good as this would divert money towards industry. Fiscal deficit has been maintained at a controllable level through disinvestment, which is alarming. Disinvestment funds should be used for capital expenditure only,” he said.',\n",
       " 'Nagpur: The Budget brings only small joys for common taxpayer, said financial professionals. The move to bring a standard deduction of Rs40,000 in the taxable income was appreciated by the chartered accountants. However, the proposal on introducing long-term capital gains tax on sale of shares left the them disappointed.The experts also hailed the proposal to calculate capital gains tax on real estate transactions on the basis of actual sale value, if the variation was within 5% of the ready reckoner rates. “The ready reckoner rates are calculated by the state government to assess a market value of a property. Even if the property is sold at a lower price, capital gains are calculated considering the ready reckoner rate only. The budget proposes that now the actual sale price would be taken for calculating capital gains tax liability, if it is less than within 5% of the ready reckoner rate,” said Naresh Jakhotia, a chartered accountant.The move to introduce standard deduction of Rs40,000 is appreciable indeed. However it comes with doing away tax exemption on transport and medical allowances included in the salary. The exemption of Rs34,200 was available on both allowances clubbed, if bills were submitted. Now the exemption has been removed putting in place standard deduction. Considering this, the net benefit due to standard deduction comes to only Rs5800, said Jakhotia.At Vidarbha Industries Association (VIA) where it is an annual practice to assemble for watching the Budget, the sentiment was upbeat. Those present said not much was expected for the industries but the proposals on farm sector would indeed boost the economy.Ashok Chandak, a VIA member and also a chartered accountant, said the proposal to cover mutual funds under dividend distribution tax (DDT), will impact returns on investments from these products. With bank interest rates as well as returns on several other assets going down, mutual funds had remained one of the investments offering higher returns.At VIA, Tejindersingh Rawal appreciated the move against cryptocurrency which includes bitcoin. He said the government has for the first time categorically said it did not recognize any cryptocurrency and will take steps to eliminate its use. This is likely to bring a curb on Bitcoin, a popular cryptocurrency. Such currency does not have any intrinsic value. Cryptocurrency phenomenon has spread even in a city like Nagpur, he saidThe proposal on tax exemption for farmer producers companies (FPC) with a turnover up to Rs100 crore was also appreciated.Sanjay Moriani, a tax lawyer, said there was no major change on the tax front in the Budget. The government should have come up with some relaxation in the penalties extracted on unexplained income found during raids. At present, the rates cross 100%.(key takeaways)* Net impact of Rs40,000 standard deduction comes to only Rs5800* Move on capital gains on real estate deals welcome* Dividend distribution tax on mutual funds will cut returns* Government will finally act against Bitcoin',\n",

They will be welcome at private hospitals as well.’’ Apollo hospitals chairman Dr Prathap Reddy said, “Such ambitious out-of-the-box thinking was a burning need of the hour.’’The Budget merely announced the new scheme with no details. Wockhardt Hospitals group’s Zahabiya Khorakiwala said, “The intent is positive, as almost 40% of the underprivileged population would be able to access the secondary and tertiary healthcare, and this would increase the market size for healthcare providers radically.’’ Parijat Ghosh, Bain and Company Partner said the National Health Protection Scheme is a game-changer. However, he said the devil will be in the details. “There are lessons from countries like Indonesia, Mexico, China, Thailand that need to be addressed – managing the quantum and quality of supply infrastructure, unifying the multiple state schemes with this program, clarifying the coverage of drugs, diagnostics, procedures and financing arrangements.’’However, the announcement also came in for criticism. Dr Sunil Nandraj, former adviser to the Union health ministry, said, “Most regulations are not in place. Costs of procedures have to be fixed. The state government’s role in funding has to be fixed.’’ A researcher said, “The scheme will be is a windfall for insurance firms and private hospitals.’’',\n",

This means almost all stations in Mumbai will get escalators, as the footfall exceeds 25,000 at these.FOBs were categorized as safety features after the Elphinstone Road tragedy, in which 23 people died in a stampede on September 29, 2017. “We have not yet received figures for the budgetary allocation to FOBs, but there are indications that there will be enough funds for FOB-related work,” said a senior CR official.Jaitley also announced that all railway stations and trains will be progressively provided with Wi-Fi, and CCTV cameras will be provided at all stations and trains to enhance security of passengers.Railway officials indicate that 30 FOBs were planned on priority in Mumbai’s suburban rail section, with an expenditure estimate of around Rs 200 crore.An official said, “Work on FOBs has gained pace and is likely to be completed within eight months. Payment will have to be released to contractors for the work.”',\n",

A delegation of locals submitted a memorandum to MMC chairperson Babita Angle Prabhudessai on Thursday asking that the decision to rename the area be reconsidered.A section of Aquem-Margao residents comprising local MMC councillor Avinash Shirodkar, Arthur D’Silva, Dean D’Souza, Rajeev Gomes, Damodar Shirodkar, besides 43 other residents submitted a memorandum to the MMC chairperson Babita Angle Prabhudessai in her chamber on Thursday evening. They sought that the MMC reconsider it’s decision to rename the location opposite the church since it has been historically and popularly known as ‘Pandava Copel’ by the people of Goa due to the presence of the ‘Pandava caves’ in the vicinity and continues as such till date.Gomes said, “The residents of Aquem and surrounding areas are shocked, disappointed and sad with the absolute insensitivity displayed by the MMC whilst passing a resolution seeking to rename this area as ‘Chandrakant Keni Square.’ We find it inappropriate and improper that a location which was historically known as ‘Pandava Copel’ is suddenly and arbitrarily sought to be named as ‘Chandrakant Keni Square’ and that an individual is sought to be glorified and bestowed prominence in the immediate shadow of one of the oldest and historical churches of Goa. At the outset, we wish to state that we have deep respect and honour for late Keni for his contribution to various social issues in Goa and for being an outstanding citizen. However, we believe that we ought to have been consulted and our views take into consideration before adopting a resolution of such enormous significance and our sentiments have been deeply hurt by the failure of the MMC to do so. Thus, we request you to kindly reconsider the sentiments of the people and take appropriate measures to revoke the resolution passed by the council to name the area in front of the church as ‘Chandrakant Keni Square’ and to refrain from naming the said area as ‘Chandrakant Keni Square.’ The people of Aquem wish that the location continues to be known as ‘Pandava Copel’ in the future and that the area is not named after any particular individual, irrespective of his religion as it is demeaning.”The local councillor Shirodkar claimed to be ‘misguided’ though the MMC chairperson pointed out that he had proposed the resolution passed at the MMC special meeting held prior to Opinion Poll Day on January 16 to rename the areas near Ravindra Bhavan, Margao and the Aquem church as ‘Opinion Poll Square’ and ‘Chandrakant Keni Square’, respectively. “This proposal was signed by prominent Margao residents, including Margao MLA Digambar Kamat considering Keni’s contribution to keeping the Konkani language alive. But in view of the unpleasant situation brewing that could result in unrest and considering public sentiments as well as this petition, the function on February 3 stands cancelled. Since a certain section of society is not in favour, this issue needs to be further deliberated with all sections of society taken into consideration. We need to name various squares/chowks after prominent luminaries/legends in recognition of their contribution ad paying them a tribute. So let us have an amicable solution or understanding,” said Prabhudessai in the presence of MMC vice-chairperson Tito Cardozo and MMC councillor Angelis Pereira.',\n",

Now even edible oil and toothpaste will become more expensive. Moreover, the government has raised education and health cess from 3% to 4%. Customs duty has been increased on imported cellphones and TV sets, and a new social welfare cess of 10% has been imposed. These extra levies will only increase the cost of living. Where is the relief expected in an election year?”Pensioner Suvarna Shetty from Kandivli, though, was pleased that senior citizens had received tax exemptions towards fixed deposits and small savings as well as medical insurance.Consumers complained that while the Budget had given with one hand, it has taken away with the other. Motorists were unhappy with the reduction in excise duty on petrol and diesel by Rs 8 per litre followed by a levy of Rs 8 as road infrastructure cess.Damodar Tandel, president, Akhil Maharashtra Machhimar Kriti Samiti, said, “The Budget announced a Rs 10,000 crore corpus fund to be distributed between fisheries, aquaculture and animal husbandry nationwide. So each sector in each state will get a pittance. Meanwhile, the FM has hiked the rate of fishing nets. In effect we will lose more than we gain.”Conversely, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis said the budgetary provisions would lead to ‘Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas’. “The budget treads a fine balance between urban and rural infrastructure. Mumbai has received the lion’s share of infrastructure allocation,” he said.Real estate developers expressed mixed feelings. Some said that despite the emphasis on affordable housing and infrastructure, the budget was no “boon”.“There is no reduction in 12% GST so home buyers are disappointed. Low-cost homes are selling but high-end inventory is not in demand because of high GST rates,” said Manohar Shroff, former secretary, Navi Mumbai chapter of Maharashtra Chamber of Housing Industry.But developer Rajesh Prajapati said, “Once builders read the fine print, they will realize they can get benefits like input tax credit if they share the burden of GST.” Navy Nagar resident Kanta Kadam welcomed the announcement to instal CCTV cameras at all stations and in trains.Transporters rued that their demand for including fuel under GST was not addressed.

       " \"PANAJI: Union finance minister Arun Jaitley's move to reduce by half the customs duty on imported cashew nuts to 2.5% has come as a relief for local cashew processing units. Though the move will benefit the 10-15 major cashew processing units in the state, the industry sought for complete withdrawal of the duty which was imposed in 2016-17.Speaking to TOI, industry stakeholders said that the reduction of the basic customs duty on cashew nut imports would allow cashew processing units to remain operational for a longer duration in a year and thus lift rural employment.“We had requested for total exemption, but even this will provide some benefit. Local production has gone down and if units need to keep their workers, processing units have to import cashew nuts,” president of Goa cashew processors association, Madhav Sahakari said.The cashew processing industry in Goa comprises about 30-odd units, equally divided between large units and small units. While there are a few cashew nut exporters like Ajanta Industries and Zantye Cashew, most established processing units prefer to cater to the domestic market.Goa processes between 15,000 and 18,000 tonnes of cashew nuts per year, and the shortfall is made up through cashew imports from Indonesia, Tanzania and other African countries.“For Goan cashew processors, this reduction won’t benefit much. As per the least-developed countries (LDC) agreement, no customs duty is imposed on raw cashew from countries like Tanzania,” secretary of Goa cashew processors association Rohit Zantye said.Globally, Ivory Coast, Nigeria and Ghana together account for 25% of the cashew trade and states like Kerala and Karnataka import from these countries.Sources said that a delegation from Goa cashew processors association had met Union minister for commerce and industry Suresh Prabhu in December 2017 asking for the import duty to be rolled back.“This will help generate additional employment in the rural areas. Women are employed in this Industry,” chairman, national council for MSME Manguirish Pai Raikar said.Currently, due to shortage of domestic cashew nut production, some processing units import nuts in October, November and December to keep their units running. While large units like Zantye’s remain operational for 11 months, other cashew processing units remain active for 10 months of the year.\",\n",

Nusselein-Volhard, who won the Nobel prize for identifying and classifying 15 genes that direct growth of cells into more complex living beings, was speaking at the opening of the Nobel Prize Series India 2018 in Panaji on Thursday.“I think it should be pointed out that science is not always directly aimed at improving mankind, and often not in the first instance meant to improve mankind. I think basic research should be pointed out as a very important part of science where it is not directly aimed at discovering something helping in medicine or agriculture or technology, but just to understand complicated issues in biology, which has been quite important to fundamental research, which then later on led to important medical discoveries,” said the German scientist.Nusselein-Volhard said that, in her research, she started out just to satisfy her curiosity about how a simple unstructured egg developed into complex organisms.“We discovered a number of genes which were crucial. And it turned out later that this basic research led to the discovery of many genes and, in the meantime, several drugs have been developed on the basis of these genes and we had no knowledge of this and we didn’t want to do that. But it was very important that we understand the fundamental development of one organism,” she said.Nusselein-Volhard said that she is currently trying to determine how fish get their colours and patterns, which, again, has not had any immediate impact on any aspect for medicine.“But, I am convinced that when you work on some very fundamental problem, it will eventually lead to something that will benefit mankind.

Though there was nothing specific for Goa, industrialists and financial experts felt that the Budget, by sticking to expectations, had avoided the pitfalls of being populist or retrospective in nature.“The agriculture sector has received a shot in the arm with multiple benefits given to it. This will open employment opportunities and also help improve the economy of the rural area and help to check migration to the urban areas,” chairman, national council for micro, small and medium enterprises on ASSOCHAM, Manguirish Pai Raikar said.Though there was no specific announcement for Goa, the Budget did speak about construction of ropeways to promote tourism and promotion of investment in seaplane services.“I would have hoped that there would have been some mention of iron ore mining, some exemptions for Goa’s mining sector. But, in terms of a long-term vision, this is a great budget,” said chairman of chartered accountant association Vinesh Pikle.“Compared to earlier budgets which focused on road and rail transportation, we are now talking about Sagar Mala and Udaan. I think we are progressing in the right direction because these are modes of transport which are efficient and cheaper,” said president of Goa State Industries Association Rajkumar Kamat.President of Goa Chamber of Commerce and Industry Sandip Bhandare saw the influence of demonetization and implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) in the Union Budget. “The tax returns have gone up. The second factor is the revenue going up. In 2016-17, the growth in revenue from tax was 12.6%, while the growth till January 2018 is 18.7%,” Bhandare said.He went on to say that due to the implementation of GST, the estimate of the number of formal jobs had shown an increase. “Earlier, the estimate was that informal jobs were more than the formal jobs, but with GST, the estimate shows an increase in formal jobs and these have come to light because of the registrations under GST,” he said.Bhandare also pointed out that because of digitization, demonetization and GST, a 360 degree profile of the Indian economy was available. Entrepreneurs and chartered accountants agreed that the Budget had defied expectations of being a populist budget. With this being the penultimate Budget for the Narendra Modi government before it seeks a second term in 2019, expectations were that Jaitley would go all out to woo the voters.Experts also pointed out that with several reforms already underway and with indirect taxation in the domain of GST, Jaitley had very little wiggle room.',\n",

While there has been no dearth of funds, the railways is still struggling to complete the project that’s aimed at increasing the suburban network’s capacity. In the meantime, the project cost has gone up to Rs7,300 crore.MUTP II includes extension of harbour line up to Goregaon, laying the sixth line between Mumbai Central and Borivli, and the fifth and sixth lines between Kurla and Parel, besides many other works.Under the project, railways has been able to procure 72 rakes and converted traction system from 1500 V Direct Current to 25 KV AC current on Central Railway. However, the crucial work on augmentation is progressing very slowly. For instance, railways has completed only 10% work on Mumbai Central- Borivli six line while work is yet to begin on Kurla-Parel fifth and sixth lines. Work on extending the Harbour line till Goregaon from Andheri was held up because of encroachments, but it’s likely to open this month.The CAG had in its August 2016 report noted that “out of 43 (works) undertaken on the Mumbai suburban (network), there was time overrun in respect of 26 of them ranging from one month to 69 months as compared to the original target date of completion.” Six other works, the report said, were incomplete though the deadline had passed, taking the total number of projects delayed on CR to 32. On WR, it found \"time and cost overrun in all the 21 projects\" it examined.TIMES VIEWThe problem is not planning or announcements, which have been plenty, but the delay in implementation. Projects almost invariably fail to meet deadlines, leading to cost escalation, and even those that are on schedule could see a rise in total money spent.

       " 'NEW DELHI: BJP lost all the three seats to Congress in byelections in Rajasthan on Thursday, ringing alarm bells for the Vasundhara Raje government, which faces assembly elections in 10 months.However, Congress lost one assembly seat in West Bengal to the ruling Trinamool Congress, which also emphatically retained the Uluberia Lok Sabha seat. Significantly, BJP beat CPM and Congress to emerge as the runners up in both Uluberia LS and Noapara assembly seats in Bengal.In Rajasthan, Congress recorded comfortable victories in both Ajmer and Alwar Lok Sabha seats. It had lost the two seats to BJP by huge margins during the 2014 Modi wave.READ ALSOBypoll results to make Sachin Pilot strongerJAIPUR: The Congress sweep in Rajasthan bypolls is bound to strengthen PCC chief Sachin Pilot who has been facing competition from former chief minister Ashok Gehlot and AICC general secretary C P Joshi over the state leadership. Though Joshi has largely stayed away from the state politics for pastCongress also wrested back the Mandalgarh assembly seat which it had lost in 2013 when Raje rode to power with three-fourths majority in the state.Consolation for BJP in BengalThe bypoll defeats in Rajasthan on Thursday will worry BJP all the more because Congress led in all 17 assembly segments where polling was held — eight each in Ajmer and Alwar parliamentary constituencies, and Mandalgarh.An elated Congress president Rahul Gandhi tweeted, “Well done Rajasthan Congress! Proud of each and every one of you. This is a rejection of BJP by the people of Rajasthan.”The biggest victory for Congress came in Alwar, where Congress’s Karan Singh Yadav defeated BJP’s Jaswant Singh Yadav, a cabinet minister in the Raje government, by over 1.96 lakh votes. In Ajmer, where Raje had begun campaigning much before the bypoll dates were declared, Congress’s Raghu Sharma defeated BJP’s Ramswaroop Lamba, son of former Union minister Sanwarlal Jat whose demise led to the bypoll. In Mandalgarh assembly seat, which had a triangular contest since a Congress rebel was in fray as an independent, Congress’s Vivek Dhakar recorded an easy victory over BJP’s Shakti Singh Hada with a margin of almost 13,000 votes.A consolation came for BJP in the form of the West Bengal bypoll results, in which the party emerged as runner-up by relegating CPM to the third position. However, TMC maintained its ascendancy by securing more votes than the combined share of all other parties in both seats — Uluberia Lok Sabha constituency and Noapara assembly constituency. Congress finished as an also-ran in both seats.The two results, taken together, confirmed West Bengal’s lurch towards a bipolar polity — with BJP shaping up as the principal opposition to Trinamool — which was last on show in the 2017 local elections.Thursday’s bypoll result announcement, which coincided with Congress’s Sonia Gandhi holding a meeting of the opposition in Parliament, came as a shot in the arm for Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee.“Soniaji congratulated me. I also congratulated her,” Banerjee said, referring to the Congress’s spirited performance in Rajasthan.“The bypoll result is a people’s victory. All parties should come together against BJP. We should plan for one-to-one fights against the BJP,” she said.',\n",

We do not need too much allocation as no work can be carried out unless all the sanctions are received from the railway board, Union cabinet and the state government.”The official pointed out that even for MUTP III, the initial allocations were Rs 1 crore and Rs 5 crore in 2015-16 and 2016-17 respectively, and increased to Rs 411 crore later. “All projects initially get token allocation, but a note in the budget makes it clear MUTP III-A is well on course of execution,” the official said.Aformer railway official said, “MUTP III-A is like old wine in a new bottle. The bhoomi pujan was to be done on August 15, 2016 but it got stuck in bureaucratic mire. Even the extension of harbour line up to Borivli and more lines up to Virar are being done as compensation for scraping the Bandra-Virar corridor.” Besides, the communication based train control system was to be part of MUTP III but was dropped because of cost.

The projects include the Airoli-Kalva Link, the quadrupling of the Virar-Dahanu line, the procurement of 47 AC rakes, and building infrastructure to prevent trespassing (mainly, track crossing, which leads to hundreds of deaths in the Mumbai Region every year).This year, Mumbai Railway Vikas Corporation (MRVC), the implementation authority for MUTP, is expecting an allocation of Rs 500-600 crore for the third phase projects. Execution of work will begin in the next financial year, which starts from April. In 2017-18, MUTP III got an allocation of Rs 411 crore, but even contractors for the listed works are yet to be finalized.“Though allocation was substantial, barely Rs 15-20 crore was spent,” said a senior MRVC official. “This year, we need to spend on land acquisition, besides making payments to contractors. We plan to conclude the loan agreement with the World Bank for MUTP III (both MUTP I and II are World Bank-funded). Also, there are chances that a few projects under MUTP IIIA (see story below) may be included in MUTP III.”Under MUTP III, WR will quadruple tracks between Virar and Dahanu.At present, Virar-Dahanu suburban services are double-line, overlapping with the main line Mumbai-Ahmedabad/Delhi route.The main line is over-saturated and there is no scope for supplementing suburban services here. A railway official said the construction of an additional double line in the Virar-Dahanu corridor will address commuter demand, facilitating an extension of suburban services from Churchgate to Dahanu Road. The Panvel-Karjat double line too is part of MUTP III, to provide an alternative route from Karjat to CSMT via Panvel, which will be shorter by 23km than the existing route via Kalyan. It will reduce CSMT-Karjat travel by 35-40 minutes by slow locals.',\n",

Also, when NCP chief Sharad Pawar called a consultation of the opposition earlier this week, Congress made it plain that Sonia Gandhi is still the head of the grouping.In the backdrop of fears that the anti-BJP bloc may unravel, Congress chose to address the reality of competitive politics within the “secular” camp. Sonia said the threat of “ideology of hate” (highlighting incidents of riots) and “attack on the Constitution” cannot be ignored.The twin issues serve as glue in the opposition bloc, with “hate” appealing to “secular vote-base” and “threat to the Constitution” morphing into a political appeal to SCs and STs. The 17 parties in attendance agreed on the need to stay focused on the “threats”.The participants included NCP’s Sharad Pawar and Praful Patel, Trinamool Congress MP Derek O’Brien, JMM’s Sanjeev Kumar, RJD’s J P Yadav and Samajwadi Party’s Ram Gopal Yadav besides leaders of other parties.Another uplifting factor for the beleaguered opposition, which could bond them better, seems to be the gains being made against BJP.

One such vehicle was involved in death of 12-year-old boy Piyush Ghode whose throat was slit by protruding iron sheets from the vehicle.Following’s Piyush’s tragic death, the police undertook a special drive against such vehicles and 300 were fined on Wednesday alone.DCP (traffic) told TOI, “In 2018 till January 29, total 3677 vehicles were fined. As per the Indian Penal Code Section 283, the fine is irrespective of the size of the vehicle and is only Rs200. The section ‘Whoever, by omitting to take order with any property in his possession or under his charge, causes danger or any obstruction, in any public way, shall be punished with fine.”A rider gets fined Rs500 for not wearing helmet and endangering own life but only Rs 200 for such dangerous transportation that endangers others life, he added.Dr Anjan Chatterjee, advocate of High Court of Bombay, Nagpur Bench, told TOI, “According to the Section 190 (3) of MVA, the carriage of goods which are dangerous or hazardous to human life, shall be punishable which may extend to Rs3000 or with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year, or both. The fine and imprisonment could increase as per the seriousness of the act.”the DCP added that the specific timings have been decided for transportation of large goods. Heavy vehicles carrying such goods are expected to move before 6 am and after 9pm from the city. During day is between 12pm and 4pm there is some flexibility.Chatterjee stated due to the increase in population and traffic, the flexible timings should be changed. He added that fining the driver could not be the only solution. The cops should allow the vehicle to continue in the same manner. Instead goods should be transferred to another vehicle that can carry them safely.TOI had reported that deceased Piyush had failed to notice the vehicle having iron sheets as the driver didn’t place any reflectors on it. “Though the vehicl was not moving, the driver had brought the goods from somewhere else and traffic police ignored the vehicle on road that caused the tragic accident,” said Hudkeshwar PI SB Mane.RajuWagh, an executive president of ‘Apghat Mukta Nagpur’, suggested, “The owner, traders of hardware companies or construction material vendors should be served legal notice and alerted with strict order regarding the charges in case of violation.” The members of the association, which have been formed under NMC, should be called for meetings to prevent the accidents due to human error, he added.Traffic expert Vinay Kunte stated, “In India, the life is cheap and the trucks carrying protruding loads are the bread and butter and a big source of earning for all concerned. If the traffic police and the RTO are not doing their job, how can anyone be safe on the road? Every day we see so many trucks, pickups and autos carrying long bars and metal sheets hanging out and without any red or white cloth tied to the rear end to warn the following vehicles. No action is taken to unload the materials.”Traffic police have provided WhatsApp number- 9011387100 and requested citizens to provide the date and location, route and image of the vehicle along with its registration on the given number. It would be shared with the traffic police of the respective chamber and immediate action would be taken.',\n",

Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd (MSEDCL) has successfully electrified 30 out of the total 38 unelectrified villages it had identified for conventional electrification. Work in the remaining eight will be accomplished by March end.Kokameta Tola, a hamlet located more than 200 km from the district headquarters deep inside the jungles of Bhamragarh tehsil, was added to the tally of electrified villages on Tuesday. Despite the hamlet having only 11 houses, MSEDCL’s Bhamragarh sub-division laid 2.5-km-long high tension line and over 1km-long low tension line through the forest to take power to the village. So far, all these 11 families were using kerosene lamps to brighten their house. They all were provided power connections free of cost under Saubhagya scheme. Chief engineer Dilip Ghugal himself travelled through the forest up to the hamlet to formally switch on power supply to the village.Ghugal told TOI that a total of 66 non-electrified villages were identified in Gadchiroli district in a survey done back in December 2016. “Of these, 28 villages are located in such a difficult terrain and deep inside the forest that taking conventional power supply lines to them was impossible. Hence, these 28 villages were handed over to the Maharashtra Energy Development Agency (MEDA) for electrification through non-conventional means like solar power. MSEDCL’s Chandrapur zone was shouldered with the task of remaining 38 villages, out of which 30 have been successfully electrified,” Ghugal claimed adding the remaining work will be accomplished within two months.

       " 'Nagpur: A team of city’s three adventurers in their 50s thought it would be a good idea to have coffee atop Mount Kilimanjaro, one of the highest summits in the world. The intention was to step outside their comfort zone and be one with the nature.The crux of this adventure was reaching the summit on the 69th Republic Day and unfurling, what they claimed to be, the largest Indian flag on top of a mountain.Paediatrician Ravi Waikar, anaesthetist Aarti Kelkar and adventurer Avinash Deoskar planned to scaled Kilimanjaro in Tanzania, Africa. They had planned it in the last week of December. The ascent to the volcanic mountain’s highest point, Uhuru Peak, is a staggering 19,341 feet above sea level. The team ascended and descended the summit in seven days between January 21 and 27.“I simply asked my friends (Waikar and Kelkar) if they would fancy having coffee on Mt. Kilimanjaro. The idea here was to celebrate life instead of being cooped up in our safe zones,” said Deoskar.Waikar said, “The journey to the summit was very exhaustive and we were eager to descend and rest properly. The euphoria sets in a few days later and then you get a sense of your accomplishment.”Kelkar, who is still revelling the experience, said, “It was a test of how far out of my comfort zone I could go. While preparing for the trip, I didn’t realize the scale of the adventure. All I knew was this opportunity might never come again.”In the seven-day trek to the peak, the trio was faced with rain and snowfall, sub-zero temperatures and altitude sickness. A disciplined routine helped in keeping their health in check. “There were some young foreigners in our group who had to return due to altitude sickness,” said Waikar.The group followed the principal of ‘climb high, sleep low’ between six camps to acclimatize with the lack of oxygen above 8,000 feet. This meant they would climb in the day-time then descend to the next camp before darkness.The group would end up walking for as much as 18 hours a day. “We would not realize how chilly it was until we stopped. Walking was a crucial way of keeping our bodies warm. Drinking water regularly was important, even if one isn’t thirsty,” said Kelkar.The group would resume the trek early in the morning. Except on January 26, when the group started ascent to Uhuru at 12am local time. At around 8am the trio was on the summit. “We had brought the Indian flag made of satin which measured 40x30 feet. We unfurled the tricolour with help from fellow climbers and sang ‘Jan Gan Man’ at the highest point in Africa,” said Waikar.“The route we had chosen to reach Mt. Kilimanjaro was utterly beautiful and comprised tropical forests and arid deserts with exotic flora, fauna and native people. And that was the ultimate intention of this trip: to explore places we’d never think of and synchronize with nature’s rhythm,” said Deoskar.',\n",

The coloured gemstone jewellery market in India is pegged at Rs 5,500 crore per annum with 85% of the gemstones being imported.Many African countries producing rich gemstones including Tanzania have banned the export of gemstones weighing 1 gram or more to encourage local industry. However, gemstone manufacturers in Jaipur and Surat have sent artisans to these countries to cut and polish the stones and export it to India. An estimated Rs 700 crore worth of preforms and cut and polished coloured gemstones are imported per annum.Demand for gemstones has increased with changing consumer preference. Apparently, these colours are connected with the Gods of various castes and creeds. Hence, the demand for every type of gemstone emerges during various festivals. If middle-class consumers are planning to buy diamond necklaces, they could do it with the studding of the coloured gemstones in the ornaments, thereby reducing the cost by almost 40%.Rajiv Jain, MD of Jaipur-based Sambhav Gems, a leading coloured gemstone company, told TOI, “It is going to be a costly affair for consume-rs planning to buy yellow sap-phire, ruby, tanzanite, etc, as import duty has been hiked.”Ajay Sharma, a dealer of coloured gemstones in Jaipur said, “Annual exports of coloured gemstones including tanzanite, emeralds, sapphires and rubies are pegged at Rs 1,200 crore. Jaipur has been importing around Rs 400 crore worth of cut and polished Tanzanite from the Republic of Tanzania. The hike in import duty will make the stones costlier and exporters here will lose out in competition with China and Thailand.”',\n",

The reason was that the effective value of such piece of land was considered zero by them. However, if shrimp farmers were to be given the benefit of Kisan Credit Card, it would become easier for them to get finance. If the Union Budget has extended the benefit of Kisan Credit Card to aqua farmers, it would give a boost to their business.”Velji Masani, chairman of Gujarat Fisheries Central Cooperative Association Ltd, said, “Our fishermen remain practically unemployed for four months during the off-season in the year.

Globally, most of the financial centres host a unified regulator in the same centre, which helps it promote the facility. Government of India’s initiative duly supported by all existing regulators would go a long way in establishing GIFT IFSC as a global financial Hub,” said Ajay Pandey, managing director and group CEO, GIFT City.The Budget also proposed providing more concessions for IFSC as the government has endeavoured to develop a world-class international financial services centre in India.“In order to promote trade in stock exchanges located in IFSC, I propose to exempt transfer of derivatives and certain securities by 29 non-residents from capital gains tax. Further, non-corporate taxpayers operating in IFSC shall be charged alternate minimum tax (AMT) at concessional rate of 9% at par with minimum alternate tax (MAT) applicable for corporates,” the FM stated in the Budget speech.Terming the Budget as very positive for India INX, the international exchange of Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) at GIFT IFSC, V Balasubramaniam, MD and CEO said, “All transactions on our exchange will now be exempt from capital gains (both long term and short term) in derivatives for all non-residents, which include both foreign portfolio investors and eligible foreign investors.

       " 'Finance minister Arun Jaitley announced a number of measures to address rising farm distress. The big move seems to be on moving minimum support prices above 50% of cost. He specifically said, “Madam Speaker, in our party’s manifesto it has been stated that the farmers should realise at least 50% more than the cost of their produce, in other words, one-and-a-half times of the cost of their production.Government have been very much sensitive to this resolution and has declared minimum support price (MSP) for the majority of rabi crops at least oneand-a-half times the cost involved. Now we have decided to implement this resolution as a principle for the rest of crops.”This is being hailed as a game-changer. What is not clear in this statement is whether the government is thinking of cost C2 (the comprehensive cost of the farmer), or only Cost A2+FL (paid-out costs plus imputed wage of family labour). If it is the latter, it was always higher than 50% for most of rabi crops for the last 10 years.Even in 2013-14, the last year of the previous government, MSP for wheat was 106% higher than its Cost A2+FL; for rapeseed mustard it was 133% higher, and for gram 73% higher.So, there is nothing new in this announcement. Claiming this to be the most historic decision is putting one self and the farmers in an illusion. The farm stress with this announcement will not go away an inch.The demand of the farming community and the recommendation of the Swaminathan Committee was 50% above Cost C2, which would require a jump in MSP of, say, paddy and soyabean by 44%, of maize by 47%, of groundnut by 38%, and of long staple cotton by 52%.This would have severe implications for food inflation, food subsidy, and distortions in cropping patterns. I don’t think that this type of cost plus pricing is feasible, without giving consideration to the demand side.Other measures such as creation of Rs 10,000-crore fund for fisheries and animal husbandry are steps in the right direction, but one does not see that allocation in the expenditure budget. Will it be raised by NABARD, and for how many years, is not clear from the speech of the finance minister. One will have to wait and watch to get its details.Also, agri-marketing infrastructure fund of Rs 2,000 crore, and Rs 500 crore fund for Operation Green for tomatoes, onions and potatoes (TOP), and tax concession to FPOs, solarpowered irrigation with facility to put surplus power back into the grid, are all steps in the right direction, but they will take time to deliver.The finance minister did mention that DBT (direct benefit transfer) has been a great success, and India is running the biggest DBT programme in the world. But unless food and fertiliser subsidies are put in DBT, it will remain a partial success. The current method of giving fertiliser subsidy is not really DBT. The money needs to go directly to beneficiary accounts, and the fertiliser sector set free of controls. Only then will the industry and farmers both gain.In brief, the Budget takes steps in the right direction, but MSP claims of 50% higher than cost, by scaling down the concept of cost itself to Cost A2+FL, is not going to be helpful to farmers.(Ashok Gulati, ICRIER)',\n",

But this is, in a sense, for core areas like roads, ports, railways and aviation.The Budget allocations go much beyond these with the aim of developing physical assets to deliver services to people, especially in rural areas, and enhance, in the PM’s words, “ease of living” and create jobs.“The focus of the government next year will be on providing maximum livelihood opportunities in rural areas by spending more on livelihood, agriculture and allied activities and building rural infrastructure,” the FM said.In 2018-19, ministries will spend Rs 14.34 lakh crore, including extrabudgetary and non-budgetary resources of Rs 11.98 lakh crore, the finance minister said.Jaitley reckons these investments — ranging from constructing school buildings, rural roads, net connectivity and water supply systems, to giving free power connections to poor households — will end up creating employment of 321 crore person-days, 3.17 lakh km of rural roads, 51 lakh new rural houses, 1.88 crore toilets and provide 1.75 crore new household electric connections, besides boosting employment.The programme to provide universal access to energy to the poorest of poor, according to Deloitte’s Debasish Mishra, “is going to transform the socio-economic landscape of India”.The power ministry’s Saubhagya scheme envisages providing free power connections to four crore poor households and the oil ministry’s Ujjwala plan envisages free LPG connections to 8 crore such families.At a macro level, an expansion in infrastructure will also spur growth in demand for core industrial products such as steel and cement, and boost other economic activities.Harsh Jagnani of rating agency ICRA sees the Budget emphasis on developing airport infrastructure by five times, and raising the outlay for the aviation ministry to Rs 4,086 crore in 2018-19, as a timely intervention required to keep pace with robust growth in passenger traffic.',\n",

There was a bias against manufacturing as people may have preferred to go for market investments. Plus, the assets were being differentiated because on immovable property you were paying capital gains tax after two years.... When gains are quite substantial in the market, 10% can surely be absorbed,” Chandra told TOI in an interview.At the same time, he suggested that the government had taken care of the interests of a wide section of taxpayers without adding significantly to the burden through an additional 1% cess. “The cess is on the tax and not on the income. If your tax is Rs 1 lakh, your liability will go up by only Rs 1,000. So, not much will be taken away,” Chandra said.The chief of the income tax department said the benefit of the Rs 40,000 standard deduction will be available to a wider set of individuals, including pensioners and junior employees who may not be getting the annual transport and medical allowance that adds up to over Rs 34,000. “Everyone is not getting transport allowance of Rs 19,200 and everyone is not getting medical allowance of Rs 15,000. Now, there is no need for producing bills, fake or otherwise. There is clear standard deduction of Rs 40,000. Many people like pensioners were not getting it. There will be some benefit for everyone,” he said.Chandra added that benefits had been offered to 2.5 crore salaried employees, lakhs of senior citizens as well as MSMEs by way of 25% tax on income up to Rs 250 crore.Asked if sufficient steps had been taken to widen the tax base, the CBDT chief said that a number of steps had been taken over the last few years, including simplified returns. “We need to strike a balance. We are widening the tax base and we are also making efforts to deepen it. Now, we are getting intelligence from third-party reporting by banks, mutual funds and large establishments and we match it with the returns and based on risk analysis, we take up the case for scrutiny. If needed, we go for enforcement action,” he said.',\n",

BMC’s TB officer Dr Daksha Shah said that the ‘direct benefit transfer’ is a welcome step because it would help in adherence to treatment. At present, a percentage of patients drop out of treatment due to side-effects such as nausea and vomiting; nutritional support would help such patients continue with treatment. The BMC had a couple of years back tried offering ready-to-cook food packages, but it didn’t meet with wide success. It then started offering foodgrain. On Thursday, finance minister Arun Jaitley said that Rs 600 crore would be allocated for nutritional support to TB patients in India. The funds will be transferred directly to the patient’s account every month.The BMC has for the last two years been providing some nutritional support for drug-resistant TB patients. Ration in form of foodgrain was being provided to approximately 2,500 patients with multiple drug-resistant TB.',\n",

Plans for redevelopment of 600 major stations, escalators on all stations with a footfall of over 25,000, CCTVs at all stations and on trains to enhance passenger security were announced.The 92-year-old practice of a separate Railway budget was discontinued last year as it was made a part of the Union Budget, and the “Red book” of projects will be available only next week. The outlay is Rs 17,000 crore higher than the previous Budget’s.The plan for doubling 18,000km and work on 5,000km of third and fourth lines to convert them into broad gauge and transform almost the entire network into broad gauge was revealed.Around 12,000 wagons, 5,160 coaches and 700 locomotives are being procured in the year 2018-19. Stressing safety, Jaitley said, “Maintenance of track infrastructure is being given special attention. Over 3,600km of track renewal is targeted during the current fiscal.”Around 4,267 unmanned level crossings will be removed in the broad gauge network in the next two years.Other major steps include increasing the use of technology like ‘Fog Safe’ and ‘Train Protection and Warning System’. Of the Rs 1.48 lakh crore capital expenditure, Rs 73,000 crore will be for safety activities.',\n",
       " 'Mumbai: With Union finance minister Arun Jaitley announcing around 150 km of additional suburban network for Mumbai at a cost of over Rs 40,000 crore, Mumbai Urban Transport Project IIIA is likely to get on track with a token allocation. The project includes elevated corridors on some sections.The MUTP III-A, proposed on January 12, comprises the CSMT-Panvel hi-speed corridor, Virar-Diva-Panvel corridor, redevelopment of 16 stations and procurement of 210 AC trains besides extension of harbour line from Goregaon to Borivli and laying of fifth and sixth lines between Borivli and Virar.While the project is estimated to cost around Rs 50,000 crore, Jaitley’s mention of Rs 40,000 crore has fuelled speculation that some of the works under MUTP III-A may be have been dropped.A senior Mumbai Rail Vikas Corporation official said, “MUTP III-A will be included in the budget by way of a token allocation of not more than Rs 5 crore. We do not need too much allocation as no work can be carried out unless all the sanctions are received from the railway board, Union cabinet and the state government.”The official pointed out that even for MUTP III, the initial allocations were Rs 1 crore and Rs 5 crore in 2015-16 and 2016-17 respectively, and increased to Rs 411 crore later. “All projects initially get token allocation, but a note in the budget makes it clear MUTP III-A is well on course of execution,” the official said.A former railway official said, “MUTP III-A is like old wine in a new bottle. The bhoomi pujan was to be done on August 15, 2016 but it got stuck in bureaucratic mire. Even the extension of harbour line up to Borivli and more lines up to Virar are being done as compensation for scraping the Bandra-Virar corridor.” Besides, the communication based train control system was to be part of MUTP III but was dropped because of cost. Later, it was included under MUTP III-A, he said.',\n",

       " 'Mumbai’s rail system is being expanded and augmented to add 90km of double line tracks at a cost of over Rs11,000 crore,” said Union finance minister Arun Jaitley in this budget speech on Thursday.Jaitley’s reference, according to railway officials, was to projects that are part of MUTP III, or the third phase of Mumbai Urban Transport Project. The projects include the Airoli-Kalva Link, the quadrupling of the Virar-Dahanu line, the procurement of 47 AC rakes, and building infrastructure to prevent trespassing (mainly, track crossing, which leads to hundreds of deaths in the Mumbai Region every year).This year, Mumbai Railway Vikas Corporation (MRVC), the implementation authority for MUTP, is expecting an allocation of Rs 500-600 crore for the third phase projects. Execution of work will begin in the next financial year, which starts from April. In 2017-18, MUTP III got an allocation of Rs 411 crore, but even contractors for the listed works are yet to be finalized.“Though allocation was substantial, barely Rs 15-20 crore was spent,” said a senior MRVC official. “This year, we need to spend on land acquisition, besides making payments to contractors. We plan to conclude the loan agreement with the World Bank for MUTP III (both MUTP I and II are World Bank-funded). Also, there are chances that a few projects under MUTP IIIA (see story below) may be included in MUTP III.”Under MUTP III, WR will quadruple tracks between Virar and Dahanu.At present, Virar-Dahanu suburban services are double-line, overlapping with the main line Mumbai-Ahmedabad/Delhi route.The main line is over-saturated and there is no scope for supplementing suburban services here. A railway official said the construction of an additional double line in the Virar-Dahanu corridor will address commuter demand, facilitating an extension of suburban services from Churchgate to Dahanu Road. The Panvel-Karjat double line too is part of MUTP III, to provide an alternative route from Karjat to CSMT via Panvel, which will be shorter by 23km than the existing route via Kalyan. It will reduce CSMT-Karjat travel by 35-40 minutes by slow locals.',\n",
       " 'NEW DELHI: Stung by the farm distress that has hurt BJP, the Budget tried to assuage farmers, promising remunerative prices by fixing minimum support price (MSP) of upcoming kharif crops at 50% higher than the cost of production, and also developing allied sectors like fisheries and animal husbandry.Finance minister Arun Jaitley’s promised increase in MSP is a break from the incremental approach in the past that was dictated by concerns that large jumps translate into higher food inflation that over time spreads to other sectors too. But the farm discontent witnessed in the Gujarat election — where a problem of plenty rather than failed crops hurt BJP — may have changed the party’s thinking.The Budget, however, does more than rely on MSP. It looks to strengthen rural markets, expand irrigation network and extend farm credit to ensure higher productivity, better market play and diversification.Talking of a “paradigm shift” from the earlier agriculture policy which remained “productioncentric”, the Budget spoke about focusing on value addition and tapping fisheries and livestock and promised to launch ‘Operation Green’ to promote Farmer Producers’ Organisations (FPOs). This will connect vegetable growers with consumers. Besides allocating additional funds for ongoing schemes and creating new funds for measures like upgrading 22,000 rural ‘haats’ (gramin agricultural markets), the government proposed to hike the farm credit target for the next fiscal by 10% from Rs 10 lakh crore to Rs 11 lakh crore.Calling the move on MSP a “historic decision”, Jaitley tasked the Niti Aayog with arriving at a “fool-proof” institutional mechanism so that farmers get full benefit of the announced support price. The Aayog will consult central and state governments and put in place a mechanism to ensure procurement work properly. “Increasing MSP is not adequate and it is more important that farmers should get full benefit of the announced MSP,” Jaitley said.The Aayog’s mechanism can either be direct procurement at MSP or by paying farmers the difference between MSP and market price as Madhya Pradesh does through ‘Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana’ (price deficiency payment scheme).Fixing MSP of crops at 50% more than the cost of production was a promise of the BJP manifesto and is a major demand of farmers’ organisations. Though it is not clear which formula the government will use while fixing MSPs in future, Jaitley’s speech hints at using the same formula which the government had used to arrive at MSPs of rabi crops for the current crop year (July-June).Jaitley also announced tax incentive for companies registered as Farmer Producer Companies for promoting post-harvest activities. As far as ‘Gramin Agricultural Markets’ (GrAMs) are concerned, the government decided to link them with the e-NAM platform and exempt them from regulations of APMCs (regulated ‘Mandis’) to eliminate agents.',\n",
       " 'The Budget presented by finance minister Arun Jaitley has provided two direct sops for creation of jobs. It has corrected an anomaly in the income-tax (I-T) Act, which hindered India Inc from claiming tax benefits for new employment, and announced that for the first three years, the government will bear the employer’s share of contribution to the employee provident fund.Section 80JJAA enables India Inc to claim a benefit of 30% of the additional employee cost for three years, including the year in which the new employment is generated. This benefit can be claimed by companies having a turnover of more than Rs1 crore.But some stringent conditions created a stumbling block. An individual employed for less than 240 days in the first year was not treated as an additional (or new) employee. Thus, if an employee had worked for less than 240 days in the first year but worked throughout the year over the next two years, the company could still not claim the benefit of this deduction in any of the three years.So, companies wanting to claim the benefit of this deduction were reluctant to hire post July in any given year as the new employee would not meet the requisite number of 240 days of employment.The Budget has clarified that benefits of this section will be available in case of new employees, who are employed for less than the minimum number of days in year one but remain employed for the minimum number of days in the second year.However, there has been no change in the other condition, that the salary of the new employees should be less than Rs 25,000 per month. “For the service sector, it means that they will largely be unable to take the benefit of this deduction,” said the CFO of a software company.Another boost has been provided for job creation, as the government will contribute 12% of the wages of new employees across all sectors, towards EPF. This contribution will not have to be made by the employer. The benefit will be available for the next three years. The fine print on this will be available when a specified scheme to this effect is rolled out.With the government facing questions on the job front, creating employment was a theme that ran through the Budget, ranging from reduction of corporate tax to the promise to spend Rs 14 lakh crore on rural infrastructure and livelihoods. The proposed rural spend on 3.17 lakh km of roads, 51 lakh new houses, 1.88 crore toilets and 1.75 crore new household electric connections are expected to translate into employment as well.',\n",

       " 'NEW DELHI: You’ll have to wait for the global oil market to cool off before your fuel bill comes down.The Budget pared excise duty on petrol and diesel, but took away the benefit by raising cess by an equal amount. So there’s neither a Budget shock nor cheer for motorists.In other words, if pump prices aren’t jumping on higher cess, they aren’t coming down either because of the excise cut. This means you’ll have to continue to pay more for motor fuels in tune with rising global crude prices.The Budget reduced the basic excise duty by Rs 2 a litre to Rs 4.48 on petrol and Rs 6.33 on diesel. But at the same time, the road cess, also described as additional excise duty, was rechristened ‘road and infrastructure cess’ and raised by Rs 2 to Rs 8 a litre on both fuels. There’s a view in the industry that a lower excise duty will help pare pump prices if crude cools off in the days ahead.This will depend on whether the road cess is being levied as a percentage of the price. Deloitte’s Debasish Mishra also sees an upside. “The excise cut signals that the government does not want consumers to pay beyond current levels of retail prices and pricing deregulation is here to stay.This sends a strong signal to investors that the Modi government’s reform measures are for the long term,” he said.In the meantime, consumers are sure to fret over the fact that the government had cumulatively raised excise duty on petrol by Rs 11.77 per litre and on diesel by Rs 13.47 a litre between November 2014 and January 2016, taking advantage of global oil prices dipping to $30/barrel levels.But fuel bills have been steadily rising since August last year as global oil prices rebounded on a production cut deal between Opec and other major producers such as Russia that sucked out excess supply in the market.Crude has jumped to $70/barrel level since Opec and Russia on November 30 extended the production cut deal by a year.This has pushed pump prices to record highs in many cities, with petrol price hitting Rs 80 a litre in Mumbai. Public anger too has risen on the government’s refusal to cut excise further after last year’s reduction of Rs 2 announced on October 3.The government has steadfastly maintained that it has done its bit and it was now for states to reduce VAT.Alternately, it wants motor fuels to be brought under GST, which will then do away with excise duty. After the Centre reduced excise in October, only five states reduced VAT, while the debate over bringing fuels under GST continues.Congress had made the high excise duty on fuels and rising pump prices an issue in the last session of Parliament.',\n",

At the moment, India is woefully short of airport infrastructure.Aviation minister Jayant Sinha said air traffic in India (domestic and international combined) was expected to touch 100 crore over the next 15 to 20 years, up from an expected 20 crore in the fiscal 2017-18. “We want to be ahead of requirement and, for that plan, to increase airport capacity by five times under a new initiative — NABH (NextGen Airports for Bharat) Nirman. This will cost about Rs 4 lakh crore. The viable airports will be run by private players and the unviable ones by the Airports Authority of India (AAI). The balance sheet of the AAI shall be leveraged to raise more resources for funding this expansion,” Sinha said.The push comes at a time when the lack of airport infra in major cities has rung alarm bells. Amitabh Khosla, International Air Transport Association (IATA) India head, said: “IATA anticipates India will become the third largest aviation market by 2024...

       " 'NEW DELHI: From burnishing its pro-poor credentials to appeasing the restive, sprawling rural constituency and speeding up job creation, the Budget seeks to achieve crucial objectives for PM Narendra Modi and his party in the run-up to the 2019 polls.For several years, the government considered bringing back the longterm capital gains tax on equities but dropped the idea because of the fear of a stock slump. On Thursday, the government bit the bullet and seems poised to reap benefits for summoning the courage to stop incentivising a tiny section.The calculation is that the levy on capital gains on equity will, in part, provide the funds needed for ‘Modicare’, supposed to be the world’s largest public-funded health insurance scheme, an audacious initiative which should bury the political insinuation that Modi’s was a “suit-boot ki sarkar”.The charge had looked an exaggeration after the government managed to sell demonetisation as a wealth redistribution scheme, a tool which robbed the corrupt rich to pay the honest poor.The sheer optics of a Budget — which blends the imposition of capital gains tax with ambitious schemes of health insurance for the poor and paying farmers 50% over the cost of production along with benefits for women and senior citizens — should blunt whatever punch, if any, the “Ambani-Adani taunt” would have still packed.If the setback among Gujarat farmers warned government of rural unrest due to stagnation in agriculture, the Budget shows that the BJP leadership did not waste time imbibing the message.The plan to cushion producers and consumers of perishable crops like potatoes, onions and tomatoes against the vagaries of production should help deal with grouses that took away from the government’s success in checking runaway inflation under the UPA and dulled the appeal of its welfare moves.Expansion of MSP cover to 24 crops covering 90% of arable land, extension of credit facility to animal husbandry and dairy farming and the plan to extend the benefit to share-croppers and lessees should calm a countryside that’s displayed its annoyance with BJP yet again by going with Congress in the Rajasthan bypolls.The measures will amplify the message that Modi has sought to put across by providing free cooking gas connections to the poor, reaching electricity to thousands of unlit villages and constructing subsidised houses for the rural populace at a fast pace.Micro, small and medium enterprises have been celebrated as the new potential engine of growth, with benefits proposed to compensate them for the hit they took post-demonetisation and in the wake of GST rollout.Concern for job-creation that fits the conventional description was reflected in FM’s incentives for labourintensive sectors of leather and textiles and the nudge to employers to formalise jobs.Sullenness among youth — another constituency, which like farmers, turned out in huge numbers for Modi in 2014 — has emerged as a major worry. The government expects jobs to emerge from the thrust on infrastructure as well.Absence of tax relief for the middle class may not necessarily reflect a shift of affection away from Modi. It is sure to upset vocal categories, with the surprise decision to announce fixing salaries of MPs fuelling angst.But what looks like an ommision in a perfectly political budget may perhaps also be an indication that it may not be this government’s last one before it faces the popular test.',\n",
       " 'NEW DELHI: Thursday saw two Budget speeches being delivered. Just after the finance minister had finished speaking in Lok Sabha, PM Narendra Modi delivered a speech to outline the benefits and the vision of the budget, an exercise that looked like the sounding of the poll bugle.Unlike the customary post-Budget remarks of his predecessors as well as his own on the last three occasions, the PM spoke for a good 25 minutes, this time detailing provisions of the Budget: an effort which while underlining his imprint on the exercise also reinforced speculation that the government from now on would be in full poll mode with the budget as one of the battle cries. “This Budget strengthens the foundation stone of ‘New India’ with a focus on agriculture to infrastructure. It covers aspects such as health plans for the poor and middle class and it has plans to increase the wealth of small entrepreneurs,” Modi said.Modi said the emphasis of his government’s last full-year Budget ran from food processing and fibre optics to road and shipping and from rural India to ‘Ayushman India’ and Digital India to Startup India while also addressing the concerns of the youth, senior citizens and women.The PM invoked the aspirational element of the Budget and promised to boost growth and jobs. “Ease of doing business as well as ease of living are in focus in this Budget.More savings for the middle class, new generation infrastructure for 21st century India and better health assurance — all are concrete steps towards ease of living,” Modi said. Like the FM Modi, too, made a detailed mention about how the Budget was farmer-friendly.“I appreciate the decision to provide for one-and-a-half times’ remunerative price for the cost incurred by farmers. The Centre will put in place a sound system in consultation with states to ensure that farmers can avail the full benefits of this decision,” he said.Budget gives wings to the poor: ShahBJP president Amit Shah said the “record allocation” for the rural sector and agriculture would lead to unprecedented development and farm growth. “This Budget gives new wings to the aspirations of the poor, farmers and the middle class,” Shah said.He said there was “tremendous stress” on improving ease of living for the common man and this was happening with improving affordability and access.He termed ‘Ayushman Bharat’ an unparalleled initiative to ensure health insurance as well as health assurance. Protecting 10 crore families, which is 40% of the population, with a health cover of Rs 5 lakh per family was a global first, he said.BJP veteran LK Advani said the PM and FM had made India proud by presenting a Budget that combined ambition and empathy of “unprecedented order”.',\n",

The objective of the session was to provide a common platform for industry leaders and media to view, discuss and analyze the sectoral implications of the Budget.Senior industry representatives were present at the session to give their reactions after going through the Budget. Here are the reactions from some of the industrialists:Deric Fernandes, MD, Deco Equipments, said, “To address the problems faced by MSMEs, better access to finance and reducing the income tax to 25% with annual turnover of up to Rs 250 crore will help the growth of both employment and economy. Also, the finance minister mentioned that the government will soon announce measures to address the non-performing assets among MSMEs, which is in the right direction.”Amit Kumar, business unit head, L&T Electrical & Automation, L&T Mysuru, said, “The Budget looks good. The industry had expected that it will be a populist Budget and it seems like Arun Jaitley has done a good job in terms of addressing fiscal deficit as it is very important for the country’s economy. Health sector and rural infrastructure have got the much needed push. But there are a few more things that could have been done, including green infrastructure, FDI in education etc.”C K Sabareeshan, former chairman, CII Mysuru, said, “Focus on agriculture and farming sector was the dire need and farmers can look forward for better price realization now. The Budget also addresses issues like housing for all, MSMEs, employment generation. Emphasis on healthcare by providing facilities to 50 crore people was unexpected and a great move to reduce India’s health burden.”‘Election budget’Members of the Mysore Industries Association dubbed the Budget as agriculture and industrial development budget, but also criticized the government for presenting an ‘election budget’. Secretary of the association Suresh Kumar Jain said, “The government speaks of digital India on one hand and on the other it has increased the prices of computers and mobiles. The Rs 11 lakh crore announced towards agriculture loans is a welcome move.”He also said that solar pumps for agricultural land will boost industries and protect farmers’ interest.

In 1994, Shankarlinge Gowda, SA Ramdas and Maruthi Rao Pawar won the elections by strengthening the party at the booth-level, and because of our ideology. We will have to repeat the feat in this election.”Dubbing the upcoming elections an ‘ideological war’, Ravi exhorted the workers to fight with determination. Ravi also touched upon the Nav Bharat Sankalp vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Lambasting the Congress government in the state, which has proposed to drop names of those accused of communal riots belonging to certain communities, Ravi said, “Schemes were earlier designed along caste lines, and they are now being withdrawn along the same ones. We have to first understand corruption in various schemes.”BJP leaders Ramdas, HV Rajeev and city BJP president BH Manjunath were also present at the executive committee meeting.',\n",

The court has directed him to furnish two bail bonds of Rs 2 lakh each. Also, he has been asked to deposit his passport with the CBI court and cooperate with the investigating agencies.Paul was arrested by the CBI in December 2016 in connection with his involvement with the Rose Valley. The agency alleged that he was in the board of directors of at least two Rose Valley firms and received remuneration even when he was an MP. They also alleged that being an MP, he had written to former President Pranab Mukherjee, seeking a probe against three ponzi firms, but was silent on Rose Valley.“The hearing was concluded in last December and CBI had filed a chargesheet. The CBI has got no new material in connection with the case. He has been detained for long,” said Paul’s lawyer, Siddartha Das. “He will abide by all of the conditions laid by the court. As soon as we get certified copy of the court’s order, we will complete the necessary paper work,” he added.The CBI on Thursday said the window to oppose the bail was still open and they would decide on that soon.Paul’s health has been a cause of concern for the correctional home authorities. Suffering from multiple ailments, he had to be shifted to private hospitals from Jharpada correctional home several times. He had to be admitted to hospital on the day he was sent to jail. Since then, his health parameters have been fluctuating. “He is quite ill and needs constant monitoring by doctors. Right now, he is at the jail hospital,” Das said.',\n",

Besides being kicked and punched, the three doctors — emergency ward in charge Syed Rafi Ahmed and his juniors Asif Ayub and Sourabh Majumdar — were assaulted with wooden chairs and tables.But before the crowd could charge on further, other doctors and staff members, along with the policemen posted at the hospital outpost, chased them away. Three persons, Habib Bakshi alias Raja, Md Siraj Ahmed and Shahjadi Begum, were rounded up.DC (SED) Kalyan Mukherjee said Sk Arshad Hussain, a resident of Topsia 2nd Lane, was brought to the emergency ward of the hospital around 1.30am on Thursday. On checking, Dr Ahmed recommended immediate hospitalization and as Hussain was being shifted to the ward, he reportedly died. Within 15 minutes, around nine members of his family barged into the emergency ward, shouting and abusing the doctors, alleging negligence, Mukherjee said. The family alleged that the doctors did not attend to the patient in time.When Dr Ahmed tried to pacify the family, pointing out that other patients were being disturbed, they beat him up. They attacked Dr Ayub and Dr Majumdar with chairs and tables as the two tried to intervene.Following the attack, junior doctors threatened to strike. However, the hospital authorities convinced them not to take such a step after a meeting of the representatives of junior doctors and the hospital administration, the heads of different departments, police and the hospital’s Rogi Kalyan Samity chairperson, Dr Santanu Sen. “It is unfortunate that junior doctors often have to face such assaults. We are taking all measures to step up security at the hospital,” said Dr Pitbaran Chakraborty, medical superintendent and vice-principal at CNMCH.Based on a complaint lodged by Dr Ahmed, a case has been registered under sections 332 (voluntarily causing hurt) and 34 (common intention) of IPC, along with section 4 of West Bengal Medicare service Personnel and Medicare Service Institutions (Prevention of Violence and Damage to Property) Act 2009.

       " 'Kolkata: Mamata Banerjee’s party maintained its ascendancy in Bengal, securing more votes than the combined share of all other parties in both seats that went for bypolls this Monday.BJP won the race for the runner-up position — comfortably in the Uluberia Lok Sabha constituency and not so comfortably in the Noapara Assembly constituency — with CPM continuing its remarkable slide in a state where it was in office less than seven years ago. Congress finished as an also-ran in both seats, which also saw a surge in NOTA votes.The two results, taken together, confirmed Bengal’s lurch towards a bipolar polity — with BJP shaping up as the principal opposition to Trinamool Congress — which was last on show in the 2017 local polls.Thursday’s bypoll result announcement, which coincided with Congress Parliamentary Party president Sonia Gandhi’s holding a meeting of the opposition in Parliament, came as a shot in the arm for Bengal CM Banerjee. “Soniaji congratulated me. I also congratulated her,” Banerjee said, referring to the Congress’s spirited performance in Rajasthan.“The bypoll result is a people’s victory. All parties should come together against BJP. We should plan for one-to-one fights against BJP. I believe the BJP will be voted out of office in 2019,” she added.Uluberia Trinamool candidate Sajda Ahmed (the seat fell vacant after her husband, Sultan Ahmed, passed away) created a milestone of sorts by securing 7.6 lakh votes (60.9% of the total votes cast), 13% more than her husband’s tally of 5.7 lakh votes in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls. She defeated her nearest rival, BJP’s Anupam Mallik, by a margin of 4.7 lakh votes, bringing to mind CPM candidate Anil Basu’s eyebrow-raising victory from Arambag in the 2004 Lok Sabha polls; his winning margin was 5.9 lakh votes. Uluberia also saw a spike in NOTA, which garnered 11,768 votes.The Trinamool’s spectacular win came chiefly from its especially strong show in three assembly segments: Udaynarayanpur, Shyampur and Bagnan. BJP has made some dents in the Trinamool and CPM vote banks in the other two segments — Uluberia East and Uluberia North — that have Trinamool MLAs, H A Safwi and Nirmal Majhi, respectively, but they were not enough to stop the Trinamool’s march. But BJP has one important takeaway from the Uluberia bypoll: it has gained a ready activist force that, for the first time, has been able to throw some sort of a challenge to the Trinamool vote machine.“Our party has been gaining ground consistently and has come up as a strong number two from number four. Our party has got the support of erstwhile Left and Congress voters,” BJP state president Dilip Ghosh said. “But we are yet to get the floating votes that are crucial for winning polls,” he admitted, accusing the Trinamool of polarising voters and saying that it was time the Trinamool became wary counter-polarisation.Trinamool Noapara candidate Sunil Singh also gobbled up the opposition, securing more than 51% of the votes in a constituency that the party had lost to the combined Congress-CPM candidate in the assembly election less than two years ago by a slim margin of 1,095 votes.Singh, also the Garulia Municipality chairman, polled more than 1 lakh votes and won by a spectacular margin of 63,012 votes. The second-placed BJP candidate secured 38,708 votes. The massive win will help Singh and his relative, Trinamool Bhatpara MLA Arjun Singh, to establish their command in the entire Barrackpore belt and marginalise their detractors within the Trinamool.CPM’s continuing slide, which started exactly 10 years ago in the 2008 panchayat poll, does not bode well for the party as it prepares for another panchayat poll this summer. Its polling percentage came down to 11% from the 2014 LS 31.1% in Uluberia and, in Noapara, the combined tally of the CPM and the Congress was barely more than BJP’s tally by barely 7,000 votes.',\n",
       " 'On January 31 evening, when many were savouring the visual grandeur of the Super Blood Red moon, over 300 Hyderabadis were seated inside a dark hall at HICC witnessing a play of lights and shadows of a different kind. It was a choreography titled ‘Hakanai’, a first-of-its-kind concept that blends contemporary dance with digital art installation and music.Devised by Adrien and Claire B Company, a French theatre company, sometime in 2012, the production which used CGI (Computer Generated Imagery), video projection mapping and sensors to ‘interact’ with the performer on stage, effortlessly blurred the line between real and virtual.“The word ‘Hakanai’ in Japanese means something which is fleeting and is very short lived; something like a dream, a fit of rage or a brisk spell of rain. It’s an old Japanese word. The performance is a scenography involving a digital glass box and a performer,” says Virginie Barjonet, the choreographer of the performance, who first came across the unique production in 2015.As described by Barjonet, the choreography took shape inside a translucent glass cube where a direct interaction happened between the digital installations and the performer. As the performer entered the box and ambient music filled the air, the images on the walls started responding to the movements of the performer which were in sync with the music. Be it the performer’s violent whirls or subtle hand movements in line with varied human emotions, the walls and the changing graphics responded to them creating extraordinary visuals that awed everyone in the hall.Performer Priyabrata Panigrahi says, “The Company was looking for a contemporary dancer for the project and held an audition in at Attakkalari Dance Academy in Bengaluru. Being a contemporary dancer and alumni of the institute, I thought of giving it a try and landed the project.”Priyabrata adds that though unique, as a dancer he didn’t have much problem understanding the whole concept. “Synchronising with the digital platform wasn’t difficult as it’s being programmed in such a way that it responds to your movements. But the rehearsals were tough as the box wasn’t flown into India till the last moment and I had to dance without it. I first performed with the box only on the stage, on the day of our first show in Bengaluru,” he avers. The 40-minute performance had the audience glued to their seats. The exceptional graphics and their ‘conversations’ with Priyabrata’s movements created a splendid visual treat that was acknowledged by a roaring applause. Afterwards, the audience too was invited to enter the box and experience the sensory walls first-hand.',\n",

The incident took place in the hospital’s seven-storeyed Raja Ram Mohan Roy building.Firefighters suspect a lit cigarette butt thrown on a heap of garbage beside an abandoned toilet near the male medicine ward on the second floor started the fire.Though it was controlled within 30 minutes, the incident raised question about patients’ safety in hospitals.The ward had around 50 patients at the time of the incident. As smoke billowed out, patients who could walk on their own rushed down. The ones who required assistance were helped out by relatives and hospital staffers.Biswajit Naskar, a thalassaemia patient, said, “I heard people screaming that a fire had broken out. I was scared. The nurse on duty asked me not to panic and escorted me out of the building.”Even before the fire tenders arrived, security guards jumped in to douse the flames with the help of hospital staff members. PWD also disconnected power supply to the second floor to prevent any short circuit. They ensured that the fire did not spread.“My wife was in the female medicine ward on the fourth floor. We were scared the fire might spread to the upper floors,” said Nazrul Sipai, whose wife was admitted at the hospital. “However, the doctors and nurses assured us that the fire was small and helped me bring her down.” Two fire tenders were pressed into service to douse the fire.This is the second such incident that the hospital witnessed in the past seven months. On July 29 last year, a fire broke out at the maternity ward .Medical superintendent and vice-principal at the hospital Dr Pitbaran Chakraborty said, “A team effort and the firefighting infrastructure installed in the hospital ensured that the blaze was contained quickly. It did not cause any casualty or major damage.”The fifth floor of the building houses cardiac patients. Prompt action by the hospital staff ensured that smoke could not reach the floor. Patients from the ward were shifted to the floors above and the ground floor for some time.WATCHPatients evacuated after blaze panic',\n",

The outfit is part of a module that triggered a blast at Bodh Gaya during the Dalai Lama’s visit on January 19. The duo told the cops that the IED recovered at Bodh Gaya was sourced from West Bengal.Apart from ammonium nitrate — a cheap fertiliser that can be used to make deadly explosive devices, electronic devices, gloves, other chemicals and booklets were recovered from the duo. Ammonium nitrate is harmless on its own and safe to store, but can be used as the main ingredient to make an explosive device. In 2013 Hyderbad blasts, only 1kg of the chemical was used to make two IEDs that killed 16 people.Both the accused arrested on Wednesday are residents of Murshidabad and have confessed to police that they wanted to “avenge the continued genocide and torture of Rohingyas in Myanmar.” Police suspect, little-known Rohingya terror group Aqa Mul Mujahideen (AMM) has developed ties with the the JMB, just like the Jaishe-Mohammed (JeM) cell in Jammu and Kashmir.The accused have been identified as Md Paigamber Sk(24) of Kankuria village in Murshidabad’s Samserganj and Jamiul Sk (31) of Dakshin Para (Ratanpur), also in Samersanj. Paigamber was nabbed around 4pm from his house. Five hours later, Jamiul was arrested from Phansidewa in Darjeeling. The duo was remanded in two weeks’ police custody by a local court.Police recovered a huge quantity of chemicals from their houses. Kolkata Police, with the help of state and central agencies, has been carrying out raids across three districts in the state and Bihar to nab other members of the Bodh Gaya module.“We learnt that the neo-JMB, now aligned with the Islamic State (IS), was trying to reopen its sleeper cells across two districts in Bengal. Accordingly, a few people were detained for questioning. Among them were people from Murshidabad and Assam, who gave us leads on others. We finally pinned down Paigamber, whose interrogation revealed that he was trained in 2012-13 by Bangladeshi handlers, including JMB explosives expert Haath-Kata Nasirullah. Even until recently, he might have been in touch with supreme leader Salauddin. Central agencies had summoned Paigamber after the Khagragarh blasts in 2014 but was released due to insufficient evidence,” said DC (STF) Murlidhar Sharma.“The improvised explosive device recovered at Bodh Gaya might have come from Bangladesh. We are still ascertaining their exact roles in the JMB module,” said Sharma.According to sources, Paigamber told the cops that he was the Imam of Colony Para Masjid in Samserganj. He was taught at a madrassa and a local academy, run by a trust. He also in aatar (perfume) business. His aide Jamiul trades in fodder. “They visited Assam and Karnataka several times. Their Aadhaar cards are genuine. However, Paigamber, who holds a genuine passport, has no stamps that show he crossed over legally to Bangladesh,” said a senior police officer.',\n",

       " 'KOLKATA: It is not written in black and white but insiders feel that the proposed merger of three public sector general insurance companies may lead to shift of another iconic institution’s headquarters from the City of Joy. The century-old National Insurance Company (NIC) HQ on Middleton Street is likely to be a thing of the past.In his Budget speech, Union finance minister Arun Jaitley has proposed the merger of NIC, Oriental Insurance Company (OIC) and United India Assurance (UIA) into a single insurance behemoth and enlist it on bourses subsequently.Industry insiders feel that the merger implies that a new company will be formed and its headquarters, most likely, would not be in Kolkata. However, a section of insurance industry feels that Kolkata can still be the HQ of the unified outfit. If the HQ shifts from the city then that could well be a setback for the proposed financial hub of the state government in New Town. As many as 22 companies have already bought plots in the financial hub that includes NIC as well.NIC is India’s oldest general insurance company. It was incorporated in Kolkata on December 5, 1906 in order to fulfil the nationalist aspiration for Swaraj. After 66 years, during nationalisation, it was merged with 21 foreign and 11 Indian companies to form National Insurance Company Ltd, one of the four subsidiaries of the governmentowned General Insurance Corporation (GIC) of India.Kamal Parekh, former president of Calcutta Stock Exchange, was worried that a merger means shifting of NIC though it would be good for the company’s financial health. Bijay Murmuria, director of Sumedha Fiscal Services, was optimistic that the HQ of the unified company can be in Kolkata. “NIC and United India are of same size and Oriental is much smaller in size. Now, between NIC and United India, the former is the oldest and has a rich history. So, I am optimistic,” he said. Rahul Agarwal, director of Optima Insurance Broking, and Rajesh Agarwal, head of research of AUM Capital, feel it’s premature to discuss on the HQ shift.',\n",

       " 'KOLKATA: If Kolkata gets a second airport, it is likely to be a private one developed on the lines of public-private partnership (PPP) rather than a facility developed by staterun Airports Authority of India (AAI).Discussing the need for larger airports in metro cities like Kolkata as outlined in the Union Budget that proposes to increase the country’s airport capacity by five times, AAI chairman Guruprasad Mohapatra stressed on the need to select a site for the second airport in Kolkata to keep the growth momentum going.“All four metros — Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata — need two airports each. The sites have been identified for Delhi (Greater Noida’s Jewar region) and Mumbai (Navi Mumbai). Tamil Nadu will finalize the site shortly. West Bengal has also agreed to scout for land. Once the land is identified, the development strategy will be finalised. But it is likely to be on a PPP basis rather than be funded by AAI,” said Mohapatra.While AAI intends to leverage its balance sheet to raise more resources to fund the expansion of airports, the AAI top executive wants the resources to go into development of non-metro airports where it may be difficult to attract private participation.In his budget speech, Jaitley announced that domestic air passenger has grown by 18% over last three years with airlines placing orders for over 900 aircraft. Kolkata airport grew by 24% in 2016-17 when passenger count increased from 12.76 million in 2015-16 to 15.82 million in 2016-17. This year, the rate of growth is pegged around 28% with passenger count set to shoot beyond 18 million.Though there is space for expanding the terminal at Kolkata, which is expected to handle over 17 million passengers this year against the rated capacity of 20 million passengers per annum, the problem with Kolkata is the absence of alternative runway to take more flights.Though Kolkata airport has two runways, simultaneous operations cannot happen due to the lack of mandatory separation between the two. When the airport layout was planned and runways were built in the 1930s and 1940s, the planes were much smaller than the aircraft of today. Thus the required separation between runways has been increased. Kolkata airport has recently increased its primary runway capacity from 30 flights per hour to 35 flights.“By making smart changes, Kolkata airport can add capacity. But it does not have the capability to expand to the extent that a second airport will not be required,” explained Mohapatra.',\n",

       " 'NAGPUR: The budget has not been able to raise the spirits of the middle and upper middle class in city who were hoping the government would provide them some relief in terms of income tax. “They should have raised the slab to at least Rs3 lakh as that would have benefited a very big chunk of people,” said businessman Perseed Jall adding that otherwise too he was not expecting anything. “The so-called sops for elderly are also nothing to write home about,” he added.Expressing her disappointment with the budget, entrepreneur Aruna Jagtap said, “The current issues that the middle class is struggling with have not been resolved. The fuel prices are so high we are actually learning use it sparingly. Change in prices of gold, silver or property prices either ways does not impact our lives, it is the day to day stuff that matters and we should be left with more money in our pockets. This budget does not address them,” she said.Not at all excited about the budget, Avantika Chitnavis, trustee of Chitnavis Centre, who also runs a artefact and lifestyle store said, “The announcement about health care sounds so fantastic. But it is ambitious too as from where will the government find the money to implement all this?” Terming the budget as one that will generate a negative sentiment in stock market, businessman Ashok Daga said, “Today from young to elderly, everybody relies on stock market to get some return on their investments. By bringing back the long term capital gains tax, the government is discouraging these investments too. This budget is not a nice one for investors.”Looking for sops to exporters which would make them more competitive in foreign markets, art designer and entrepreneur Gurdeep Kapoor said, “Tax rebates can give exporters the right push. We will have to wait and watch how the newly rolled out Trade Infrastructure for Export scheme works out.”The proposal to offer 1.5 times the cost to farm produce does not consider the actual investment of the farmer on the ground, said a medium level farmer Purushottam Bhattad. “The government should consult the farmers to find out the actual investment cost before deciding on these figures. We also wanted that a product which is grown in a particular region should get the best price there itself. For this, nearby markets which buy at fixed rates would be welcome. The government has made many provisions for agricultural sector. I only hope that they are able to implement them effectively, “ he added.',\n",

       " \"NEW DELHI: Finance minister Arun Jaitley on Thursday read out long portions of his speech in Hindi. The repeated resort to the vernacular, as much as the content of what he said, revealed the political nature of his Budget. The appeal was primarily to sections that make up the numbers at the hustings – the poor, farmers, lower middle class, young jobseekers, senior citizens.In sharp contrast, the well-heeled will have to pay more income tax , including cess, as well as for imported goodies like cellphones, TVs and high-end cars. They’ll also see the taxman claiming his cut of what they gain from successful punts on the stock market.Union Budget 2018: Complete CoverageThe contrast is expected to serve as a message of the Modi government’s attempt to reassure the constituencies that will be key for BJP’s fortunes in the state elections due this year and, more importantly, his re-election in 2019. It completes the transformation of a government, which was seen as pro-market when it came to office, into a promoter of welfarism. It is an extension of the drive to ‘image-correct’, most dramatically showcased till now by demonetisation in 2016.Read full text of Arun Jaitley's Budget speechThat politics, more than economics, was the flavour of the day showed also in the willingness to slacken fiscal controls. The current year is estimated to end with a deficit of 3.5% of GDP against the target of 3.2% and next year’s goal is now 3.3% rather than the 3% it should have been according to the government’s pre-set ‘glide path’.Even this target appears somewhat ambitious given the promised welfare splurge on health, agriculture, senior citizens and rural infrastructure, all of which put together would “build a New India 2022”, according to the minister. The Budget numbers left several questions hanging over how exactly all of these are to be funded .READ ALSOUnion Budget: Are you richer or poorer? Here’s the bottomlineStandard deduction has been revived, saving some tax, but that’s in lieu of medical allowance and transport allowance. It has also increased the cess on incomes from 3% to 4%, hiking your tax bill. So, what’s the net effect of these three changes? Union Budget 2018: Complete CoverageThe numbers are premised on 11.5% growth in nominal GDP, in line with 7-7.5% real growth projected in the Economic Survey, with inflation at 4-4.5%. Whether high oil prices and the government’s intent to boost farm produce prices will fan inflation and throw these assumptions out of kilter will be watched. The enormous scale of the proposed welfare schemes means the challenge of implementing them in time to reap benefits in the 2019 polls will be correspondingly huge and will be a race against time.READ ALSOBudget 2018: From Audis to iPhones to large TVs, you will have to fork out substantially moreGet set to shell out more for luxury as there’s a rise in duty on import and assembly of high-end cars and motorcycles as well as devices such as Apple’s iPhone. Televisions will also get dearer as customs duty on parts used in LCD, LED and OLED panels is set to go up.For the poor, the Budget promised “the world’s largest government-funded health care programme”, which by the end of the day was widely being dubbed Modicare – an insurance scheme that will provide a cover of Rs 5 lakh a year for 10 crore families, or about 40% of India’s population. The key could lie in how quickly the government identifies beneficiaries, puts mechanisms in place, and gets them rolling while ensuring the gains aren’t skimmed away by insurance firms and private hospitals – a tough ask, but one which holds the potential of being Bhajpa’s Brahmastra a year from now.Budget for Bharat before poll MahabharatIf implemented with reasonable success, the proposed mega health insurance scheme will mark a huge stride towards creating a social security net for the underprivileged in a country where healthcare is scarce and costly.For farmers, there was the promise that minimum support prices for the crop to be harvested post-monsoon this year will be at least 50% higher than what it costs to produce. The government will also ensure that MSP is actually available to many more cultivators than at present. Details on both these ambitious schemes — in terms of what the model will be and how they are to be funded — were scanty in the Budget documents, but the FM later said he was confident money wouldn’t be a constraint.Again, delivery will be crucial. But if the cost+50% scheme gets off the ground, BJP can have a realistic shot at appeasing a restive countryside and its teeming numbers who gave BJP a big hand in 2014 but have since vented their frustration in Gujarat and, on Budget-day, in the Rajasthan bypolls.For those with relatively modest incomes, the return of standard deduction on income tax, at Rs 40,000, meant a saving on their tax bill would be partly negated by a 4% cess for education and health replacing the current 3% cess for education and by the doing away of exemptions for medical and transport allowances. For those with higher incomes, the math works against them as the cess more than erodes the tax savings.Young job-seekers, however, can take heart from the promise that the government will pay 12% of their wages into their provident fund for the first three years, thus incentivising employers to hire them. Women entering the organised labour force are also expected to benefit from having to pay just 8.3% of their salaries into the PF account for three years. A cut in the corporate tax rate from 30% to 25% for firms with turnovers between Rs 50 crore and Rs 250 crore, the FM hoped, would also provide such mid-sized units some extra cash to expand jobs.The push for employment is hoped to be complemented with the focus on infrastructure, including rural roads and housing.Senior citizens are to get a whole slew of benefits. Pensioners, for instance, can make the most of the Rs 40,000 standard deduction since they don’t lose by the elimination of the medical and transport allowance exemptions. Further, those above 60 can now get tax exemption on interest income up to Rs 50,000 against the current limit of Rs 10,000. The limit on deduction for health insurance premia or medical expenses will go up from Rs 30,000 to Rs 50,000. And if the spending is for certain critical illnesses, they can get up to Rs 1lakh deducted from their income. This sort of deduction is now available up to Rs 60,000 for those aged between 60 and 80 and Rs 80,000 for those above 80.Viewed together with the incentives for women, schemes for seniors mark the recognition of their emergence as independent political constituencies.While generously promising the moon to the aam aadmi, the FM dipped into the pockets of the high-income classes. Not only will the enhanced cess on I-T leave them net losers, he’s brought back the long-term capital gains tax, which means gains made on selling securities after a one-year holding period will be taxed at 10% beyond Rs 1 lakh. Thankfully for them, gains already made till Jan 31this year will not be taxed.The better-off will also have to pay more for their imported goods, with the FM imposing an across-the-board 10% surcharge on all customs duties and raising the duty rates on several white goods like TVs, cellphones and cars. While this move dovetails with the government’s Make in India programme, it doesn’t quite match the Prime Minister’s anti-protectionist appeal at Davos barely a week ago. But then, the PM and FM are probably looking more at Dewas (in poll-bound Madhya Pradesh) than Davos right now.WATCHBudget 2018: Hits and misses\",\n",
       " 'KOLKATA: While it is yet to be known what exactly has come West Bengal’s way in the form of new railway projects, the Chittaranjan Locomotive Works (CLW) and wagon manufacturers in the state had a reason to cheer.As Union finance minister Arun Jaitley read out the plans for railways in his Budget speech on Thursday, he mentioned that Indian Railways plans to procure 12,000 wagons, 5,160 coaches and 573 electric locomotives in 2018-19.“The railways has decided to increase wagon targets and restart purchase of coaches from trade. For Titagarh, this is a very positive step as we, along with our subsidiaries, are the largest wagon and coach manufacturers in the private sector. The railways’ investment in utilization of capacity by investing in rolling stock will positively impact Titagarh,” said Umesh Chowdhary, vice chairman and managing director, Titagarh.The railways had earlier set a target for 7,120 wagons, 4,659 coaches and 352 electric locomotives for 2017-18. According to a senior CLW official, the premier locomotive manufacturing unit in West Bengal set a target of 325 for 2017-18.“In addition to this, we aided Diesel Locomotive Works (DLW) in Varanasi to build about 25 electric locomotives. With the demand rising for electric locomotives, the railways is looking to create more capacity for their production. That is why DLW also started manufacturing electric locomotives. This year, we are likely to set a target of nearly 450 locomotives. Though the target is steep, this will be a very positive step for a production unit from the public sector,” the official added.Indian Railways has embarked on a mission of total electrification by the year 2020. This would lead to energy cost saving to the tune of Rs 11,000 crore for the railways and also increase the demand for wagons and coaches.',\n",

       " 'KOLKATA: While senior railway officials seem confident that availability of funds will not come in the way of an additional 50-odd km of Metro network in Kolkata by 2020, they don’t seem so sure about other development projects in Bengal. Union finance minister Arun Jaitley specifically announced allocations for Mumbai and Bengaluru suburban sections but nothing came up regarding Kolkata’s suburban network.Jaitley on Thursday proposed to allocate Rs 11,000 crore to improve suburban services in Mumbai, including doubling of tracks along 90kms. An additional amount of Rs 40,000 crore will be allocated to expand the network by a further 150kms. In addition, Rs 17,000cr will be spent to develop 160km of suburban network to reduce congestion in Bengaluru.“The Mumbai suburban network is used by about 7.6 million people daily. Nearly 3.5 million people use the Kolkata suburban network. Nearly 20% of people working in Kolkata’s Central Business District alone commute from the suburbs. Yet, the city’s suburban network is a picture of neglect. No significant steps have been taken to enhance capacity in Kolkata’s suburban network. As more frequent services can’t be run, 12-coach EMU locals are now being run instead of nine or 10-coach ones to accommodate more commuters. But the number keeps on increasing,” a Railways official said.When plans were made to extend the north-south Metro corridor to places like Barasat and Barrackpore, the idea was to reduce pressure on suburban services. The Metro, however, has not yet managed to reach Dakshineswar or the airport from where links to Barrackpore and Barasat were planned.Officials also don’t see much into Jaitley’s announcement of escalators at all stations with a footfall of over 25,000. According to an official, construction of escalators at such stations were planned earlier and some have been commissioned.“There have been some positive announcements in the safety front though. There was a demand for Train Protection and Warning Systems (TPWS) and it has been announced that 150km under Eastern, South Central, North Central, Southern and South Eastern Railways will be covered.

It has also increased the cess on incomes from 3% to 4%, hiking your tax bill. So, what’s the net effect of these three changes?Union Budget 2018: Complete CoverageThat depends on what your income is and whether you’re salaried or not. If you’re not salaried (those on pension, for instance), the fact that the two allowances have been knocked out doesn’t hurt you. So you gain a clean Rs 40,000 deduction on taxable income .The biggest gain from this is for someone at an income of just above Rs 10 lakh a year. With tax and cesses, such a person would now be paying Rs 1,15,875. In the new dispensation, she would pay Rs 1,08,680, thereby saving Rs 7,195. However, as your income rises, the benefit of the deduction starts being offset by the higher cess, and beyond an annual income of Rs 47,85,000 you’re more and more a net loser.Read full text of Arun Jaitley's Budget speechSimilarly at income levels below Rs 10 lakh, the benefit is not quite as much and decreases as income does. The exception to this declining trend happens at a non-salary income of Rs 2.9 lakh. Such a person would now pay Rs 2,060 in taxes and cesses. Post this Budget, they pay nothing.For the salaried, things are more complex. While they gain from the Rs 40,000 deduction, they lose out on the Rs 15,000 exemption for medical allowance and the Rs 19,200 deduction for transport allowance. Thus, their net gain is of Rs 5,800 on taxable income, which translates to a total saving of just Rs 1,740 on tax payable, irrespective of income. Offsetting this is the effect of the increased cess. The net gain is negligible even at fairly modest salary levels (Rs 194 at an annual income of Rs 5 lakh) but beyond an annual income of Rs 12,62,400 (just over Rs 1 lakh a month) there is a net loss. And the net loss keeps mounting from there on.Senior citizens, however, stand to gain from a range of proposals . For example, the limit on tax-free deposits bearing high interest of 8% has been increased from Rs 7.5 lakh to Rs 15 lakh. That means you can add Rs 60,000 to your interest income annually. Those buying health insurance for their aging parents can also celebrate. The rebate on premia has been upped from Rs 30,000 to Rs 50,000, which means a tax saving of about Rs 6,000 per annum.If you invest in equities either directly or through a mutual fund, the rebirth of the long-term capital gains tax will hurt you. Let’s say you make a gain of Rs 2 lakh from selling shares you bought more than a year ago. You will now have to give the government 10% of the amount gained over Rs 1 lakh, which in this case would mean paying Rs 10,000. The bigger the gain, the more your payout. The small mercy is that what you have gained till Jan 31 this year won’t be taxed.Equity-oriented MFs will also now have to pay a 10% tax on any income they distribute to you, so that’s another minus for you. What about indirect taxes? Do they reduce your spending? Sadly, no. A 10% surcharge on all customs duty means imported goods will cost more.READ ALSOBudget 2018: From Audis to iPhones to large TVs, you will have to fork out substantially moreGet set to shell out more for luxury as there’s a rise in duty on import and assembly of high-end cars and motorcycles as well as devices such as Apple’s iPhone.

For instance, the price of an Apple phone could rise by up to Rs 5,000.

       " 'KOLKATA: Union finance minister Arun Jaitley delighted sections of home buyers by announcing a 5% allowance on the difference between the rate at which a transaction takes place and the government-determined circle rate. This will benefit a large segment of buyers and developers in Kolkata from having to fork out income tax (Section 43 CA) on the differential amount.Across Kolkata, premium apartments in highrises constructed by reputable developers command a higher premium than four-five storied buildings promoted by local builders in another plot in the same neighbourhood. But since the circle rate is determined by a higher price, buyers of flats in the alleys as well as the builders have to pay income tax. Also, rates set by the Inspector General of Registration (IGR) in several pockets are higher than market rates.Once Jaitley’s Budget proposal goes through, buyers and sellers will not be subject to I-T even if the transaction value is 5% less than the IGR value or circle rate. However, if the difference is higher than 5%, I-T will be levied on the entire differential amount.For instance, if a person bought a 1,000 sq ft flat for Rs 50 lakh in a locality where the price of flat as per the circle rate would be Rs 52.5 lakh, the buyer was earlier liable to pay I-T on the differential amount of Rs 2.5 lakh. Post Budget, he will be exempt of I-T under Section 43 CA as the differential amount is within the 5% bracket. But if someone buys the same flat for Rs 49 lakh, I-T will be levied on the entire differential amount of Rs 3.5 lakh.“A number of buyers and sellers will get relief from this move as the transaction rarely happens at the exact market value. The government should have given a concession of up to 10% because in fringe areas, particularly those to the north and east of the city, the difference between the circle rate and market rate is 10-15%,” said Sanjay Jain of Siddha Group.While the IGR rate and market rate in several localities of Kolkata have been brought to a parity recently, small apartment projects in middle-class localities where premium condominium complexes have suddenly sprung up are confronting this problem. An Urbana near Ruby or an Altius in Tangra have hiked the IGR value.“The price differential becomes more acute in commercial properties where location advantage in the same neighbourhood can lead to huge variation in price. While a shop space that is located near a bus stand on the main road in a locality may command Rs 15,000-20,000 per sq ft, another shop the same size a few meters away in an alley may fetch only Rs 10,000 per sq ft,” pointed out Nandu Belani, Credai-Bengal president.Credai-National vice-president Sushil Mohta believes a 10% allowance would have been more helpful, particularly in suburban areas where growth is now taking place. “The difference is more than 5% in several areas including Rajarhat, New Town, Joka, GT Road, BT Road, Madhyamgram and Barasat. Buyers and sellers in these areas will continue to feel the pinch,” he said.',\n",

       " 'AHMEDABAD: Budget 2018 has indeed been ‘Charming for the farming’… a historic document for the ‘Kisaan,’ ‘Makaan’ and ‘Ayushmaan’ focusing on the maiden launch of national health protection and economic growth and development of the agricultural and rural sectors!The finance minister also needs to be complimented for the efforts of his team in widening the taxpayer base and securing an appreciable rise in the direct tax revenue growth, along with the administrative focus on ‘E-Assessment’ for greater transparency and accountability.The FM paid a rich tribute to his major constituency of taxpayers, the salaried class, who as he acknowledged, paid almost three times the income tax as compared to the segment of business and professional class of individuals, who are almost the same in number.While on one hand he has granted a respectable relief of Rs40,000 by way of standard deduction, the simultaneous withdrawal of the exemption on account of transport allowance of Rs19,200 and reimbursement of medical expenses of Rs15,000, totaling Rs34,200 has virtually left the salaried class with an effective gain of exemption of only Rs.5,800. Considering the increase in the tax burden of 1% health and education cess, quite ironically, the maximum tax relief ranges only upto Rs 1,070, with even a negative impact in higher slabs of income.No doubt, senior citizens have reason to cheer about the higher deductions for medical insurance and treatment and bank deposit interest.Capital market shock and balm!The media forecasts in relation to taxing of long-term capital gains have hit the bull’s eye. However, the perceived shock of the aftermath has been very well absorbed by the market on account of the soothing relief in respect of the ‘grandfathering’ provision as announced by the FM. The provision of adopting the fair market value as on January 31, 2018 or the actual cost of acquisition, whichever is higher, shall by and large ensure the comfort of the equity market investors in respect of their accrued gains until date. However, they will now be required to shell out the extra burden of 10% alongwith STT (which has also been retained) and this revenue gain alongwith the 10% DDT in respect of dividend on units of equity-oriented mutual funds shall go to substantially augment the tax collections from the capital market.(The author is a tax guru)',\n",
       " \"BENGALURU: Around 6.30pm on January 31, members of a WhatsApp group — mostly based in the city — were discussing TeamIndus and its aborted mission to the Moon. A little earlier, a middle-aged homemaker, part of a long queue waiting to enter the Jawaharlal Nehru Planetarium to witness the lunar trifecta, was overheard telling someone over the phone to sprinkle holy water at home once the lunar eclipse was over.The conversations represented two diverse views — of a keen interest in science and superstitious belief.Over the next two hours, social media was abuzz with posts about how people reached their destination faster than usual and how there was very little traffic. A Google Map snapshot of the city at 7.53pm showed little or no traffic at most junctions, a once in a Blue Moon phenomenon.Many Bengalureans preferred to remain indoors during the eclipse, catching traffic police by surprise. R Hithendra, additional commissioner of police (traffic), tweeted: “eclipse effect?”Prof K Chandrashekara, who teaches biology at the planetarium and works at GKVK, told TOI: “It took me only 10 minutes to reach the planetarium from Hebbal. On other working days, it takes at least 40 minutes. I never thought an eclipse would have such an effect in a city like Bengaluru, that too in 2018.”Chandrashekara, who overheard the homemaker on the phone, explained how people’s minds work. “The woman was not completely superstitious. She had come to see the eclipse at the planetarium. Yet, she couldn’t help instruct someone at home to sprinkle holy water.”HR Madhusudan, senior scientific officer at the planetarium, was baffled how people continued to follow superstitious practices, despite science debunking many of them. “I’m not sure how this can be explained,” he said.Non-overlapping magisteriaHowever, it may not be all that difficult to explain it. For instance, the Indian Space Research Organization (Isro) is known to offer special prayers at Tirupati before big launches. It was even done before the Mars Mission. Nasa has a superstition with peanuts. This doesn’t mean they lack scientific temper.It is what renowned scientist Stephen Jay Gould calls “non-overlapping magisteria”, where one can indulge in both science and religion and follow both belief systems without them overlapping.It's been 21 years since Gould first put forth his idea. And Bengalureans on Eclipse Wednesday were living proof that it’s quite valid.\",\n",

       " 'Home loans can help you save tax. Before you buy that residential property, brush up on your home economics:Tax benefits on principalEquated monthly instalments (EMIs) are typically divided into principal (the amount you took as loan) and interest (the cost of servicing the loan). Principal is allowed as a deduction from your gross total income (subject to an overall cap with other eligible investments of 1.5 lakh)Tax benefits on interest paidInterest payable on ‘self-occupied’ property is subject to a maximum deduction of 2 lakh under the head ‘Income from House Property’. This reduces your total tax liability. But to claim this, acquisition or construction should be completed within 5 years from the end of the financial year in which the loan was taken. If not, the deduction will be limited to 30,000.Additional deduction of 50,000 is allowed for first-time home buyers if certain conditions are fulfilledIf you have rented out your property, the difference between the rent you get after adjustment of municipal taxes, standard deduction and interest on housing loan is your ‘loss’. For example, if the annual rent is 5 lakh, after considering standard deduction @30% of gross value (which is generally rent), 3.5 lakh is your loss. As per Finance Act 2017 amendment, you can set off only 2 lakh of such loss against your other income, say salary. The balance (surplus loss of 1.5 lakh), can be carried forward over eight years. However, it can only be set off against your rental income.Why not to go alone on a home loan, and other useful pointers1. It makes tax sense to purchase the new apartment jointly – say with your spouse, then both of you are entitled to a deduction of 2 lakh each for interest. In case you have a working son/daughter and the bank is willing to split the loan three ways, all three can avail deduction up to 2 lakh each on self- occupied property2. A ready-to-move flat could cost more. Booking an under-construction flat may work out cheaper as I-T laws permit you to claim the total interest paid during the predelivery period as a deduction in five equal instalments starting from the financial year in which the construction was completed or you acquired your apartment (generally this denotes the date of possession). Of course, the maximum you can claim as a deduction per year continues to be 2 lakh, in case of selfoccupied property.3. Interest on a loan taken from an employer, friend, or even private lender is eligible for deduction, but you should obtain a certificate from the lender. Note that principal repayment is not eligible for deduction under 80C4. Expense incurred towards repair and maintenance are not allowed as a deduction from income from house property. However, a standard deduction @ 30% of gross value (which is generally the rent received) is allowed to compensate for repair and maintenance expenses of a let-out house property. Also, municipal taxes paid during the financial year is allowed as a deduction5. It’s best to rent out your second home from an I-T perspective. If you have not let it out, it will still attract tax on its expected market rent (known as deemed value). It’s better to pay tax on rent which you actually earnGovt takes 10% bite out of capital gainsIf you invest in the capital market there is bad news in store. Capital gains in excess of 1 lakh arising on sale of listed shares or units of equity-oriented mutual funds held for over 12 months will be taxable at a concessional rate of 10% without indexation benefit.LONG-TERM CAPITAL GAINS (LTCG)Capital gain on sale of all listed securities in India mentioned above (other than debtoriented MFs), held for more than 12 months are treated as LTCG. Unlisted securities in India and immovable property have to be held for more than 24 months to qualify for LTCG. In all other types of capital assets, including debt-oriented MFs, sale post 36 months will qualify as LTCG.SHORT-TERM CAPITAL GAINS (STCG)When securities (listed/ equity-oriented MF/zero coupon bonds) are held for up to a year, the gain is treated as STCG. For all other type of capital assets, holding up to 24/36 months will qualify as STCG.SET-OFF PROVISIONS FOR CAPITAL LOSSES ARE RATHER RESTRICTIVE• Loss from transfer of a long-term capital asset can be set off against gain from transfer of any other long-term capital asset in the same year. But, long-term capital loss cannot be set off against short-term capital gains.• Loss from transfer of a short-term capital asset can be set off against gain from transfer of any other capital asset in the same year.• Any unutilised capital loss after absorption in the same year can be further carried forward to next eight years and be utilised under the same conditions as above.• You should file your I-T return before July 31 to carry forward any losses.',\n",

Gandhian institutions in the city, including Sabarmati Ashram, Kochrab Ashram, Gujarat Vidyapith, Navajivan and the Khadi Udyog Majoor Mahajan are quite upbeat. Last year the union government had sanctioned Rs 25 crore for centenary celebrations of the Sabarmati Ashram.Recently a notification in the union gazette was issued about the formation of a national-level committee for the year-long celebrations. The committee will be chaired by prime minister Narendra Modi and will include all CMs, Gandhians and institutional representatives.For the Sabarmati Ashram, plans for disaster recovery servers for Gandhi’s digital archives, construction of a whole new activity centre and parking area for visitors have been proposed. The designs were shown to Modi during his visit to the city recently.Besides this, the state tourism department has proposed plans to develop the area around the Ashram with a cafeteria, lighting, city-wide tourist bus circuit for Gandhi heritage, a travelling exhibition, and a sound and light show at the Sabarmati riverfront.Sabarmati ashram trustee Kartikeya Sarabhai said that during British rule and the second period of industrial revolution, Gandhi was one of the first to speak on sustainability.“Today many people across the world refer to Bapu’s work and what he had to say on sustainability. The 150 year anniversary celebrations will largely focus on taking Bapu’s message across the country and the world,” Sarabhai said.Gujarat Vidyapeeth vice-chancellor Anamik Gandhi gave the information that work on the national committee and planning has already started. “Institutions are discussing ways of propagating Bapu’s constructive programmes, and addressing wider issues of social dichotomies that pose a serious threat to humankind,” the VC said.',\n",

       " 'By Ajit RanadeIt was a given that the Budget would have a substantial focus on rural and agriculture sector.Farm incomes have stagnated for the past four years, partly due to falling prices, output and import glut or demonetisation. The government is committed to doubling farmers’ income by 2022, but that would also need substantial increase in farm output and productivity. Merely price support would not do it. Even then the FM’s announcement of a big hike in MSPs was the right political signal. The Budget documents, however, reveal only 21% increase in the food subsidy Budget, as against 27% in the previous year.MSPs are like an option or insurance, and kick in only if market prices fall below the threshold. Hence budgeting for this option is not easy. The farm sector needs to be unshackled from multiple controls, which prevent direct linkage between a producer and an end consumer. Of course various initiatives like tax holiday for farmer producer companies, setting up of 22,000 modern rural agricultural mini-markets and credit flow to tenant farmers should all help. The actual impact of MSP hike remains to be seen. By far, one of the biggest announcements was India’s giant step toward universal health insurance. Covering 100 million families with Rs 5 lakh of health insurance is an ambitious step. The actual outlay is on the premiums, which can be a small fraction. But in itself it makes families much less vulnerable. Of course, apart from financing, health insurance would work only if healthcare providers are also geared up, with adequate beds, hospitals and doctors. Nevertheless a commendable step.The political thrust toward rural, agriculture and social sectors is much less burdensome on the exchequer than what meets the eye. Thus overall spending has been targeted to go up by less than the growth in nominal GDP next year. Besides, due to demonetisation and formalisation of the economy, and higher inflation, the tax collection will go up at twice the rate of spending growth. This is good for keeping the fiscal deficit in check.Disinvestment was a success this year (although some of it was the left pocket buying from the right pocket). Next year’s target is modestly ambitious and is likely to be met. The reintroduction of the long-term capital gains tax was overdue, as it brings parity with other asset classes. On the objective of job creation, there is an employment and wage subsidy scheme, whose success depends much more on the upswing of private investment spending. In summary, it was a rural and social sector focused, growth-boosting Budget with an eye on next year’s national elections.All this has been achieved without too much fiscal slippage. Given favorable global macro (despite higher oil prices), we should see higher growth across all sectors, and better fiscal situation next year.(Ajit Ranade is Chief Economist, Aditya Birla Group)',\n",

While Hyderabad IIT is a central government institute, Tribal university allocation was made in the last year\\'s budget. Since it was unutilized, the Centre has alloted the same amount again. The state government may get some amount in the scheme announced by the Centre to provide safe drinking water across the country especially fluoride and arsenic affected areas. Apart from this, the Centre announced it would take up electrification of two railway lines in the state.Finance minister Eatala Rajender at a press conference on Thursday said that the state government had asked for allocations of Rs 15,000 crore (Rs 5,000 crore each for three years) for \\'Mission Kakatiya\\', Rs 19, 205 crore for Mission Bhagiratha, and Rs 10,000 crore for Kaleshwaram irrigation project. The state government has already spent about Rs 22,000 crore of the total Rs 88,000 crore for the irrigation project. \"I met Union finance minister Arun Jailtey during the pre-budget meeting held on January 16, 2018 and requested for huge allocation for the new born state. Niti Aayog commended the schemes introduced by the Telangana government and also recommended budgetary support for projects such as Mission Bhagiratha and Mission Kakatiaya. But it is unfortunate that none of them were considered,\" Rajender said. He said as per the AP Reorganization Act, the Centre has to establish All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Rail Coach Factory, Steel Plant at Bayyaram but nothing happened.Officials said the AIIMS were considered in some states such as Gujarat and Jharkhand but Telangana was ignored. The state government in its request earlier asked for allocations for 30 Telangana districts except Hyderabad under backward districts quota. But it was not considered. During 2017-18, the Centre had allocated Rs 450 crore for backward districts. But there was no mention about the funds in the budget.',\n",

He said there were several factors in the Budget which benefit people across the spectrum. “There are some factors which benefit all. Infrastructure benefits everyone,” Jaitley said.Finance secretary Hasmukh Adhia said there were two schemes before the government on MSP and it will have to choose one scheme or states can be given both the alternatives.“There is need for deep discussion on this with states. Niti Aayog will discuss the issue,” Adhia said, referring to MP’s Bhabantar scheme, in which the price difference is paid to farmers. “The other option is providing the infrastructure for actual procurement in states. The Centre and states can share the cost for the project,” he said.The FM said high crude price could have an impact if it breaches the range with which the government is comfortable. “I am personally not willing to share my view on which way the prices will go. Nobody predicted the fall when it took place and nobody predicted the rise when it is taking place. I think there is a certain range which keeps us comfortable and if it goes beyond, obviously it has its own consequences. We are almost on the verge of that range at the moment,” he said.Adhia said the excise duty on petrol and diesel was being reduced and this would be converted into a cess and it would not impact final prices. He said the earlier road cess was being subsumed under the road and infrastructure cess to fund roads, railways and urban infrastructure.',\n",

Laws had not been amended to rectify this anomaly which occurred after the implementation of the 7th Pay Commission’s recommendations two years ago.Jaitley also proposed a law for an automatic revision of salaries for MPs every five years indexed to inflation.

Lower than-estimated collections have been a factor for the Centre missing the fiscal deficit target of 3.2% of GDP and close the year with 3.5%.Though GST rates have been cut for over 200 items since its introduction on July 1, key reasons for revenue slippage was the GST Council’s call to suspend anti-evasion steps like matching invoices of buyers and sellers and the reverse charge mechanism to keep tabs on unregistered businesses. Rollout of e-way bills was deferred till February 1.The Centre also has to compensate states if growth in collections is less than 14%.

       " 'NEW DELHI: The defence Budget has been hiked by 7.81% to Rs 2,95,511 crore amid expectations of a higher allocation due to heightened tensions with both Pakistan and China.The defence outlay works out to just about 1.58% of the projected GDP for 2018-19, the lowest since the 1962 war. Though this figure has been declining in percentage terms as the economy expands, military experts contend it should be over 2% to ensure that the armed forces are capable of tackling the “collusive threat” from Pakistan and China.The capital allocation for MoD under BE 2018-19 is 33.1% of expenditure on capital account, which is Rs 3,00,441crore.Government will bring out an industry-friendly defence production policy to promote domestic arms production by public and private sectors as well as MSMEs, said FM Arun Jaitley, adding that two defence industrial production corridors will be set up.Defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman said, “This paves the way for the first defence production corridor to come up in Tamil Nadu, linking small and medium units running from Chennai, Mysore, Coimbatore, Salem and Tiruchirappali right up to Bengaluru. The two corridors will encourage Make in India.”This year’s defence Budget, accounting for 12.10% of central expenditure, includes a capital outlay of just Rs 99,563.86 crore for new weapon systems and modernisation, which is dwarfed by the revenue expenditure of Rs 1,95,947.55 crore.Another major worry is the ballooning defence pension bill, which now stands at Rs1,08,853 crore, in addition to the outlay. Also, 70-80% of defence capital outlay goes to instalments for earlier arms deals, leaving very little for modernisation projects.Focusing on border connectivity, Jaitley said: “Rohtang tunnel has been completed to provide all-weather connectivity to Ladakh. Contract for construction of Zozila Pass tunnel is progressing well. I now propose to take up construction of tunnel under Sela Pass (in Arunachal, a site of fierce battles in 1962).”',\n",

       " 'At the end of a long Budget day, finance minister Arun Jaitley told TOI’s Sidhartha and Surojit Gupta that costs will not be a constraint for higher farm minimum support price and a mega health insurance, insisting his tax proposals will help find resources. Excerpts.› Critics say this is an election Budget.This Budget blends fiscal prudence with social and economic necessity. We have maintained the glide path, not only for this year but also for future years. The 3.5% fiscal deficit this year, one of the key contributory factors to this, is a statistical reason. This year, we get GST revenues for only 11 months — we get GST for March in April. That shortage contributes to most of the reasons for the so-called difference (in fiscal deficit estimates) between 3.5% and 3.2% of GDP. There is also an impact of a large number of structural changes.The priority obviously was agriculture, socially and economically deprived sections and infrastructure creation. On agriculture, besides a series of schemes announced, we have in principle accepted the principle of a farmer getting 50% more than his cost. We are extremely serious about implementing this decision irrespective of the cost.› What is the emphasis in the social sector?Ujjwala is a runaway success and, therefore, the eight crore poor households target is important. Healthcare is a very ambitious scheme and we envisaged that the lowest on the economic criteria — 10 crore families — should get Rs 5 lakh insurance benefit for hospitalisation at least once every year. This is India’s first mega social security scheme. The poor now get subsidised ration, we are working on housing, rural roads, electrification, toilet and a gas connection in every house, MGNREGA spending of Rs 55,000 crore and to top it, free healthcare security. The poor can look at the government as a legitimate guardian.› But the middle class is feeling left out.In the last four years, the exemption limit was increased, up to Rs 5 lakh, we brought in a 5% slab, which is the lowest in the world, there is higher exemption for house property and benefits under 80C have been raised. This time, we have a standard deduction of Rs 40,000, which will benefit many. So, anyone with annual income of Rs 5-7 lakh can end up paying very little tax. GST has freed business of inspector raj.› There is a fear that higher MSP will fan inflation.MSP has been increasing over the years and, therefore, what you have to fill up is the gap between the present price and the 50%. The effect will be marginal.› What about finding resources for the health insurance scheme?I will be able to raise additional resources from longterm capital gains tax and additional cess. This year we will also get higher revenue from GST.› Fight against black money finds a small mention.Yes.The government has done a lot in that fight and it’s a continuous battle. That has increased the tax base, it has increased the quantum of tax.› Is there a scope for another full Budget if the fiscal year is changed?I don’t think it is fair to comment on this now.› You have exceeded the disinvestment target for the current fiscal year. Would you go beyond Air India as far as strategic disinvestment is concerned?I have already said that the companies notified by the Niti Aayog remain on my agenda.› Do you think that the fiscal slippage and higher crude oil prices reduce the scope for a rate cut?I would not like to comment on an area which belongs to the RBI.',\n",

A reduction in the excise duty on petrol excise is a welcome step for it. \"Since most household items are now part of the GST system and this tax cannot be changed unless approved by the GST council, this year\\'s budget was not so much about the prices of household items. The only upsetting this for the family budgets is not much tax relief for the salaried class,\" Vandana said.\"The tax slabs should have been redefined as it has been a long back since the last big revision,\" said Sanjay Kansal. \"The slabs needed revision because rupee has depreciated. The salaried class gets standard deduction benefit of Rs 40000 but it will include medical allowance of Rs 15,000 and transport allowance of Rs 19,200. Effectively, this is very little benefit. With the cess increased from 3 to 4%, this class will actually end up paying more tax. With price rise unabated, practically we have less money in hand for savings and household expenditure.\"The children of the family, however, are happy, as the budget lays emphasis on better opportunities for education and skill development.

Sanjay\\'s mother, Santosh Kansal, said: \"As a senior citizen, I am happy for higher interest on my income up to Rs 50,000.\" Being a bank officer, Sanjay\\'s overall view on the budget was: \"Considering that it is sort of pre-poll budget and our farmers are in real distress, I\\'ll call the proposals pro-farmer and pro-poor, even a watershed budget. The biggest provision is \\'Modicare\\' on the lines of \\'Obamacare\\', where the poorest 10 crore families of 50 crore members will get annual medical care of up to Rs 5 lakh each in case of hospitalisation. It was needed. I like the provisions for farmers, be it Bamboo Mission or credit flow to agriculture and allied activities or mega food parks.

Adding insult to injury was the FM completely ignoring Telangana and AP that have been waiting for funds under the special package promised to them during bifurcation.He felt the announcement on revisiting the norms for sanctioning MUDRA loans may pave the way for increased business activities for small players that have begun recovering from the after-effects of DeMon and GST. FICCI\\'s Telangana State Council chairman Devendra Surana, said: \"It was very disappointing that instead of coming down, tax rates have gone up for corporates thanks to the 1% hike in cess, especially at a time when the US has reduced tax rates from 25% to 21%.\"While a section of industry was disappointed, some felt the focus on education, health and agriculture would strengthen the country\\'s fundamentals in the coming days. \"The impetus to agri and education sectors and access to healthcare for all may support the country in reaching development goals.

       " 'NEW DELHI: The finance minister in his Budget speech admitted that the fiscal deficit target for the current year would be missed and the goal for next year too will be not quite as stringent as envisaged. What the speech didn’t mention was that the effective revenue deficit in the current year is now estimated to be nearly twice as large as the budgeted amount — Rs 2.5 lakh crore compared to Rs 1.3 lakh crore.That is far more worrying. The fiscal deficit measures the extent to which the government has to borrow to fund its expenditure, but it does not distinguish between routine expenditure on things like salaries and investment for creating future assets. The effective revenue deficit, on the other hand, looks at the gap between routine spending and routine income from things like taxes and dividends from PSUs. In short, it shows the extent to which the government is spending beyond its means.So how did this double from the budgeted amount? Revenue receipts actually turned out about Rs 10,300 crore lower than budgeted while revenue expenditure was nearly Rs 1,07,400 crore higher than had been estimated a year ago.If the fiscal deficit slippage was contained at 3.5% of GDP rather than the targeted 3.2%, it was only because the capital expenditure in the revised estimates is about 12% lower than what the Budget had provided for. Thus, the government spent about Rs 36,400 crore less on creating future assets than it had promised to.For the coming year, the Budget targets revenue expenditure of Rs 21.4 lakh crore and capital expenditure of just over Rs 3 lakh crore.These figures are both around 10% higher than the revised estimates for the current year, but interestingly, the revenue expenditure target is almost 17% higher than in last year’s Budget while the capital expenditure figure is 3% lower than last year. Thus, while the FM’s speech may have suggested that the government is investing in the future like never before, the figures tell a different story.A closer look at the numbers also throws up some puzzling questions. The National Health Protection Scheme, the FM said, would be the world’s largest such scheme covering an estimated 50 crore people for Rs 5 lakh a year. The outlay provided on health certainly cannot be enough to cover it. So where in the Budget is the money provided for this?Similarly, will the massive hike in MSPs suggested in the speech be possible with the food subsidy increasing by just as much as it did last year? It is learnt that these have not been provided for yet, except to a very minor extent. North Block is apparenyl confident that the increased cess and long-term capital gains tax will raise more than budgeted and hence fund these schemes.But then, how meaningful are the numbers presented on Thursday? After all, the Budget is more than just a series of policy announcements. It’s ultimately primarily an account-keeping exercise.',\n",

As per the TB India 2017 report there are over 45,000 notified TB patients in the state. \"While it is a welcome step to begin with, the Rs 500 per patient for nutrition is just not enough. Also if we think of nutritional supplements by pharma companies, the amount is too little for making a difference and needs to be increased substantially. To top it, there will be an issue of monitoring that the allowance provided is used only for nutrition purpose,\" said Dr Sanjeev Singh Yadav, president Indian Medical Association (IMA)-Hyderabad unit. Dr Mahaboob Khan, superintendent, Government Chest hospital said the allocation will not do miracles in eradicating TB as the main cause for tuberculosis is not malnutrition. \"Patients usually take the medicine for a month and the minute the symptoms die down, they stop taking the medicines. Hence, it is the drugs and the implementation of the programme that needs to the focussed on,\" Khans said. Also the high cost of medicine, about Rs 3000 per month, makes many patients discontinue the treatment, added experts. The problem of patients being dumped by family members and the stigma attached to the disease too has to be addressed. \"With daily regimen patients having to collect medicines every week, the Rs 500 will not even cover their travel expenses, leave alone nutrition.

It gives an additional deduction of 5,800. However, the catch is that an increase by 1 per cent in the cess which will be payable will dampen the benefit that standard deduction has to offer. In fact, those with gross salary of up to 10 lakh will have a mere 150 saving on tax.* A drafting error seems to have crept in regarding introduction of tax on LTCGs.

The DM, who gave the builders a weeks’ time to register the flats, said the step was necessary because the Uttar Pradesh government was losing around Rs 300 crore in stamp duty.Singh told TOI the action would be initiated under Section 64C of the Stamp Act, 1899. “The FIR will be filed after sending a week’s notice to the builders,” he said. “No one will be penalised without reason. I have directed officials to examine each case with due diligence before initiating action,” he added.“Notices are being sent to the builders concerned. Under Section 64C of the Stamp Act, any violation invites a jail term of three months and a penalty of Rs 10,000,” Singh said.According to administrative officials, the state government was losing Rs 334.13 crore in stamp revenue for non-registration of flats. Section 13 of the UP Apartment (promotion of construction ownership and maintenance) Act, 2010, says a builder cannot allow possession or transfer of ownership rights of a flat without executing the registration.“We have found seven builders who have violated the Apartment Act. These are the Amrapali Group, Divine India Private Limited, Assotech, Victory Cross Road, Realtors Private Limited, AGC Ajnara Homes and Gardenia AIIMS Glory.

The incident came to light when Central Crime Branch (CCB) cops picked up main accused, plywood merchant Syed Shamshuddeen alias Syed Altaf, 40, for loitering suspiciously.Altaf confessed that he and his two sons, aged 14 and 15, had murdered his landlord Manjunath from Nelamangala, cut off his head and buried it in his land, before throwing the remains in Vrishabhavathi river near Kengeri.Altaf and his sons, residents of Haleguddadahalli on Mysuru Road, opened a wood factory in a shed belonging to Manjunath, in Kempalinganahalli a few months ago. The family later rented a house near the Nelamangala bypass.Altaf was unable to pay rent in time and Manjunath allegedly used abusive language against them.

However, lack of clarity on banning of blockchain and cryptocurrency, increase in customs duty and poor implementation of several big ticket projects like Smart Cities, Digital India and Make-In-India will also have its effect on the city.However, getting into specifics of what Bengaluru gets shows clearly that the two big infrastructure projects—sub-urban rail network and the metro rail links—have priority, while the city’s scientific institutes also have something to cheer about.While the sub-urban rail project has got Rs 17,000 crore outlay, Bengaluru will also get a pie of the Rs 15,000 crore earmarked for the expansion of metro rail links across the country.The centre hopes to add 190-km of metro rail service in the coming year, of which nearly 13 km will be in Bengaluru. Most of the funding for metro projects in the country are already cleared by the Cabinet and the mention in the budget only ratifies it, and the budget specifically mentions that the funds will go towards: “Phase-2 civil works to start in all four extensions of Bengaluru Metro.”Federation of Karnataka Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FKCCI) President K Ravi, said: “The big announcement for Bengaluru is only the sub-urban rail. In fact, in our pre-budget meeting with Mr Goyal (railway minister Piyush Goyal) we had mentioned the need for expedition of the project and we are glad that it has found a mention in the budget.”Ravi also pointed out of that the city is likely to benefit from several other schemes announced by the finance minister, which infrastructure expert V Ravichandar echoes.‘Overall I think the budget has the party’s priorities in place with the farm sector getting a lot of sops, given the upcoming elections. There are several gaps that will need further deliberation and some other schemes that will need strong implementation. And both such schemes will impact Bengaluru, like the crypto-currency and blockchain ban, which will hurt innovation, or the insurance scheme which will see state contributions and so on,” Ravichandar said.The budget has given a boost to some R&D initiatives in the science, technology and engineering sectors in the city.As part of the Centre’s research and development initiatives in IT, electronics and CCBT (Convergence Communications & Broadband Technologies), the budget has made provisions Indian Nanoelectronics User Programme, which will see 300 users at IIT-Mumbai & IISc Bengaluru. The IISc will also get a research park, one of the six in the country.In a bid to enhance competitiveness in the Capital Goods sector, the budget has cleared setting up of eight centres of excellence (CoEs), including two in Bengaluru—one each at IISc and the Central Manufacturing Technology Institute (CMTI).

In SCR, the project was to have kick-started with two ‘A1’ category stations like Secunderabad and Vijayawada, from which Railways are mopping up more than ?60 crore revenue each annually.SCR has already been asked to ramp up facilities at railway stations to remodel them on the lines of airports. The amenities that the government wants the new age railway stations to sport include ramps for elderly, earmarked parking lots, nonslippery walkways from parking lots to station buildings, earmarked toilets, drinking water taps for wheelchair-bound passengers, Wi-Fi connection, ‘May I help you’ kiosks and trolley path.“For each of the two stations, we floated tenders thrice, but it did not elicit any response. Perhaps, private parties, who had been invited to bid for the tender, felt that ramping up railway stations will not be a profitable venture for them,” said a senior SCR official.“Our plan to redevelop 37 stations did not fructify last year because it hinged on private agencies funding them. But it’s not clear whether Railways want the project to be carried out in PPP mode like the previous year. If it’s a PPP model again and if private agencies don’t come forward, the project will be stuck this year too.”However, Hyderabad, Kacheguda, Tirupati, Guntur, Kazipet and Warangal feature among remaining stations chosen for redevelopment, apart from Secunderabad and Vijayawada, officials said. Three stations like Lingampalli, Cherlapalli and Nagalapalli are also in need of an overhaul before these start functioning as new terminals. The railway board has drawn up an action plan to refurbish 600 major railway stations across India to cater to the upwardly mobile passengers, who are more comfortable taking flights for long-distance trips. “Today, railways are facing cutthroat competition from airlines and it’s the need of the hour to spruce up facilities at railway platforms,” said an official.',\n",

Now that we have stopped respecting these, we are no longer a world power. We are no more global teachers of the world, which we were earlier,” said Rajendra.Narrating how an elderly village resident shared with him indigenous techniques of water conservation, he emphasised the need to understand climate problems at the grass-root level to resolve them.

The project envisages elevated corridors within core areas of the city, enabling it to leapfrog over crucial junctions and bridges.The suburban rail project, in the pipeline since the 1990s, is being seen as a panacea for the gridlocked city and is a long-pending demand of professionals heading towards the tech corridors of Whitefield and Electronics City.According to the present plan, the Centre and state have to bear 20% each of the project cost, while the rest will be raised by means of innovative financing. The equity plan is now likely to change to 50:50 between the state government and Indian Railways, with the former ready to bear the burden of facilitating land and other responsibilities.Welcoming the budget announcement, Mahendra Jain, additional chief secretary of urban development, told TOI that the Karnataka government is ready to take the project forward. “The state cabinet has already approved investing 20% of the Phase I project cost of Rs 1,745crore over the next two years. The immediate step will be to set up a special purpose vehicle that will take up implementation of the project. We will focus on introduction of new services in this phase. Last year, we did augment some existing services by introducing MEMU as part of our commitment to push suburban services,” he said.Sanjeev V Dyamannavar, from the advocacy group Praja RAAG that has been pushing for a suburban rail network for Bengaluru, explained that the proposed suburban rail project is a larger network spanning over 440km, as it promises services to towns around Bengaluru, like Tumakuru, Mandya, Doddaballapura and Chikkaballapura, among others. The city will benefit from the network. “I see it as a positive step. The city hopes to realize its pending demand,” he added.',\n",

Agriculture experts and lawmakers from Telangana are hoping the minimum support price (MSP) and other pro-farmer initiatives announced in the Union Budget on Thursday if implemented by the Centre will help farmers in distress in the state, which has 55.4 lakh farm holdings.According to a study by Rythu Swarajya Vedika, 3,026 farmers ended their lives in Telangana since statehood till June 2017. NCRB data too confirmed Telangana tops the list. The state government is already working on a separate budget for agriculture sector and the Union government initiatives have come in handy for it as the state will get its share of funds in various schemes announced in the budget.To double farmers’ income, the Union government announced Minimum Support Price for kharif, which will be at least one-and-half times the production cost.Telangana agriculture department principal secretary C Parthasarathi said, “The Centre announced several initiatives and schemes like operation greens, rural haats for agriculture and food processing sector. We are yet to calculate how much will be the state’s share.”TRS MP Kalvakuntla Kavita said “the important takeaway is the MSP. This time, we hope the government will truly raise the MSP of all crops by 50% or more. In 2017-18, similar announcements were made, but the highest per cent hike in MSP was a meagre 10.8 per cent for rabi crop.”Consortium of Indian Farmers Associations founder P Chengal Reddy told TOI: “In Telangana, MSP for paddy is ?2,200 which they increased by 50 per cent and made it ?3,300. However, there is a rider in the Union minister’s speech that a mechanism will be developed in consultation with Niti Aayog and state governments. If the government wants to do it, they can do so directly. It is the job of Commission for Agriculture Costs and Prices to fix MSP. There is no mechanism to identify tenant farmers. In United AP, initial estimates was 5 lakh tenant farmers, but only 20,000 are given loans.”Another TRS MP Konda Visweswara Reddy told TOI- ,“Being the election year, the Center has come out with a populist budget, rural development and farmer-related issues have got importance. However, they ignored some critical issues, like they allocated just ?11,000 crores for Animal Husbandry and ?2,000 crores for Horticulture. In comparison, the Telangana budget is more progressive and common man oriented than the Union Budget, Telangana had allocated ?4,000 crores, for sheep rearing alone,”',\n",

However, lack of clarity on banning blockchain and crypto currency, increase in customs duty and poor implementation of several big-ticket projects like Smart Cities, Digital India and Make-In-India will also have its effect on the city.Bengaluru's two big infrastructure projects — suburban rail network and Metro rail links — are clearly the priority, and the city’s scientific institutes also have something to be enthused about.While the suburban rail project got a push, Bengaluru will also get a slice of the Rs 15,000crore earmarked for expansion of Metro rail links across the country.The Centre hopes to add 190km of Metro rail in the coming year, of which nearly 13km will be in Bengaluru. Most of the funding for Metro projects is already cleared by the Cabinet and the budget only ratifies it. The budget specifically mentions that the funds will go towards “Phase-2 civil works to start in all four extensions of Bengaluru Metro”.Federation of Karnataka Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FKCCI) president K Ravi said: “The big announcement for Bengaluru is only the suburban rail. In fact, in our pre-budget meeting with railway minister Piyush Goyal, we had mentioned the need for expedition of the project and are glad it found a mention.”Infrastructure expert V Ravichandar says, “Overall, I think the budget reflects the party’s priorities, with the farm sector getting a lot of sops, given the upcoming elections. There are several gaps that will need further deliberation, and some other schemes that will need strong implementation. Both schemes will impact Bengaluru, like the crypto-currency and blockchain ban, which will hurt innovation, or the insurance scheme which will see state contributions and so on,” Ravichandar said.The budget has given a boost to some R&D initiatives in the science, technology and engineering sectors in the city.As part of the Centre’s research and development initiatives in IT, electronics and CCBT (Convergence Communications & Broadband Technologies), the budget provides for Indian Nanoelectronics User Programme, which will see 300 users at IIT-Mumbai & IISc Bengaluru. IISc will also get a research park, one of the six in the country.In a bid to enhance competitiveness in the capital goods sector, the budget cleared setting up of eight centres of excellence (CoEs), including two in Bengaluru — at IISc and the Central Manufacturing Technology Institute. The two institutes will also see two of the nine Common Engineering Facility Centres to be set up.\",\n",

While Wasim Khader, the prime suspect, was arrested from Cantonment Railway Station, Phillip was picked up from Shivajinagar. The other two, Umar and Irfan, were arrested near JC Nagar.Police said the suspects and the victim were acquainted with each other and had lived in the same area — JC Nagar — for years. A fresh row on Monday triggered incidents which led to the murder. Santosh’s mother also indicated as much, but that did not stop the BJP, who claimed Santosh was a party worker, from calling it a political murder.Police, however, refused to confirm or deny whether Santosh — his mother said he was into finance business — was associated with the BJP.

Irfan is a tailor.

However, by then, with Kohli already having registered his 33rd century, India were knocking on the doors of a comfortable win.Theirs was a 189-run partnership for the third wicket in which they made South Africa's attack look toothless. In the process, be it Imran Tahir - the world's top-ranked one-day bowler, or Kagiso Rabada - the world's top-ranked Test bowler, India took a toll on them all.It was South Africa's inability to slow down the proceedings at the Kingsmead Stadium in Durban that allowed India to largely dominate the game, barring SA skipper Faf du Plessis' exceptional century.In slow conditions, India slowed down the game after being asked to bowl first and when it was time for them to bat, the visitors once again took control of their innings against a South Africa attack that didn't know how to adapt to the slow nature of the pitch.South Africa won the toss and elected to bat first on a thoroughly flat pitch which promised a lot of runs. In fact, in matches between South Africa and India alone, here at the Kingsmead, results are heavily stacked in favour of teams winning the toss and batting first.Except that the track on offer here turned out to be way too slow. With the ball taking its time coming on to the bat, India introduced their two wrist-spinners - Kuldeep Yadav and Yazuvendra Chahal - from two ends and the runs began drying up for the hosts, apart from Faf du Plessis' determined innings.The South African skipper led from the front with a splendid 112-ball 120 (11x4, 2x6) and his innings alone remained an aberration where the rest of his team's batting line-up was concerned. All-rounder Chris Morris' 43-ball 37 remained the next best South African contribution in the team's eventual total of 269/8. Pacers Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Jasprit Bumrah received no help from the track whatsoever and it was clear India had made the right choice in walking in with three slow bowlers.Du Plessis showed his team the way forward. He wasn't any more fluent than the rest of his teammates, but the skipper simply rode on all survival measures he could put in place for a well-earned century. The spinners had to give way at some point and du Plessis waited to pick on the Indian seam attack.WATCHVirat Kohli hits another ODI century, India thrash South Africa by six wickets\",\n",

They said the poor would be benefited by schemes, like free electricity to four crore households and eight crore free gas connections under Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, among others.Even as some of the businessmen were of the view that there was nothing in the Budget for the corporate sector, others said the government has not taken any harsh steps for the industry or imposed new taxes, except hiking cess on income tax marginally by 1%. They have lauded the finance minister’s decision to reduce 5% corporate tax for the companies with a turnover up to Rs 250 crore.However, there was confusion over allocation of Rs 7,148 crore for textile sector for 2018-19, as industrialists are not clear whether it is enhancement of the Rs 6,000-crore package announced last year or a separate one.Terming the Budget growth-oriented, the corporate sector was of the view that besides benefiting industry indirectly, it will usher in new era of development for the country and boost the economy.Photo quotes‘This is people’s Budget’This is a good budget.

       " 'CHANDIGARH: With Union finance minister Arun Jaitley on Thursday promising farmers an MSP that will be 1.5 times the production cost of crops to honour BJP’s a manifesto promise of implementing the M S Swaminathan report, experts have termed it as a farmer-friendly step.Prof Satish Verma of Reserve Bank of India (RBI) chair at Centre for Research in Rural and Industrial Development (CRRID), Chandigarh, said it was an appreciable step and reflects the Centre’s intent to implement the Swaminathan Commission’s recommendations. “Even if the government tries to achieve this with steps to reduce cost of production, it’s a win-win for the farmers,” he said. Swaminathan in his report had recommended giving farmers “at least 50% more than the weighted average cost of production”. The Budget further said the credit for agricultural activities was up from Rs 10 lakh crore to Rs 11 lakh crore.Dr Subhash Sharma, director, Centre for Economic Policy, Mohali, said the Modi government had taken a revolutionary decision to link the MSP calculation to cost of production. “Till now, farmers used to complain that the MSP increase was not in sync to the increase in production cost,” he said.Bhupinder Singh Mann, former MP, national president of the BKU and chairman, All India Kisan Coordination Committee, said the finance minister in his budget had “played a hoax” with farmers by announcing that the MSP would be raised 1.5 times the input cost and tried to play a bluff game with farmers. “Working of Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) is very opaque and its calculations are far from reality. According to the CACP, the formula of A2+FL cost for wheat for 2018-19 is pegged at Rs 817 per quintal while as per C2 cost it is shown as Rs 1,256 per quintal. These calculations are purely theoretical and far from reality,” said Mann.“Giving 50% over and above these would mean Rs 1,225 and Rs 1,884 for A2 and C2 calculations, respectively. This year’s MSP is Rs 1,735. Thus by this hoax, farmers are already getting Rs 510 more than cost of production as per A2 calculation,” added Baldev Singh Mianpur, president of BKU, Punjab unit. Earlier, there had been apprehensions that the Centre was not interested in implementing the report because the MSP was decided after taking into consideration all varieties as deciding a minimum 50% hike over the cost could lead to distortions in the market, it was pointed out.',\n",
       " 'PATIALA: Union finance minister Arun Jaitley’s decision to make a special budgetary provision for management of crop residue in the states of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan has been hailed by the Punjab agencies that have been fighting a losing battle against the menace of crop burning.However, the farmers’ organizations are still wary of the scheme claiming that such announcements made by the governments get caught in red tape and benefits never reach the farmers. They now want direct transfer of financial benefits to the cultivators to manage crop stubble.In his budget speech, the finance minister had termed air pollution as a “cause for concern”, and announced support to tackle the menace by providing subsidies on machinery used for crop residue management.Those in the know of things said the provision made in the Union Budget was broadly based on the recommendations by the National Steering Committee on Climate Change, which had also got a Rs 100-crore regional project sanctioned by the ministry of environment, forest and climate change in December, last year. After being included in the Union Budget, the state of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan are now hoping to get a Rs 1000-crore boost to deal with the crop residue problem.Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) chairman K S Pannu said the latest budgetary provisions were an extension of the Union government’s regional project under which special subsidies were to be provided to the co-operative societies and individual farmers for purchase of crop residue management machines.Facing heat from various quarters, including the National Green Tribunal, over the rising number of farm fires after the harvesting of the paddy crop, Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh had sought Rs 2,000 crore package from the Centre to deal with the problem.Punjab agriculture commissioner Dr Balwinder Singh Sidhu said the Rs 100 crore regional project approved by the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change had five components which include setting up of 12 demonstration clusters for 1,000 villages each, centres from where the farmers can hire straw management machines and also assisting the cultivators with subsidies, who wish to buy machines for individual farms across the state. Besides, a state-level centre was also to be set up to coordinate all these activities.It was learnt that the government was aiming at providing 75% subsidy on machinery for the co-operative societies and 50% subsidy for individual farmers.However, the state farmers are still adamant and are demanding that a compensation of Rs 200 per quintal should be given to the cultivators to manage crop residue.Jagmohan Singh, the general secretary of the Bharatiya Kisan Union Dakaunda, said 86% of the farmer were small and marginal farmers and were not in a position to buy such machines. He said giving subsidy to co-operative societies for buying crop residue management machines could be a good move, but such schemes generally get caught in red tape and never reach farmers. Instead, the government should have made a provision to provide direct financial benefits to the cultivators to manage crop residue.Budgetary proposal an extension of Rs 100 crore regional projectThe Union government had in December approved Rs 100-crore regional project to mitigate the effects of stubble burning on air quality and soil health under the National Adaptation Fund for Climate Change (NAFCC)The project had been approved by the ministry of environment, forest and climate change on the recommendations made by the national steering committee on climate change. Under the project, the initial focus was on farmer awareness and capacity building activities so that the farmers can be encouraged to adopt alternative practices to manage the crop residue',\n",

An impressive allocation to this sector means more production and more inflow of money. This is coupled with the reduced tax rates.

The charge sheet was filed before the special CBI court in Panchkula which had earlier convicted Gurmeet of rape.The two doctors – Dr Pankaj Garg and Dr M P Singh – have been charged with voluntarily causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapons or means, criminal conspiracy, criminal intimidation and cheating.The dera chief was jailed in August last year after he was convicted of raping two of his women disciples. Dr M P Singh too is in judicial custody in connection with the violence that had erupted in Panchkula after Gurmeet was convicted, leading to the death of 36 dera followers in police firing.It was on December 23, 2014, that the Punjab and Haryana high court had ordered a CBI investigation into charges of forced castration of followers inside the dera after hearing a petition by Hans Raj Chauhan. He had claimed that he and some 400 other followers were allegedly castrated with the false hope that the emasculation would lead to realisation of God through Gurmeet. It was alleged that the castration was done by doctors working for the dera’s hospital.The dera lawyers have argued that the procedure was performed with the consent of the followers. They have also contended that castration is the first step towards voluntary gender change, which is permitted under Indian laws. The court has, however, held that there can’t be consent for emasculation and the performer or abettor of the act has committed an offence.Murder conspiracy nextBesides castration, Gurmeet is also facing two cases of being part of a murder conspiracy.

       " 'Bathinda: The announcement to fix the minimum support price(MSP)of kharif crops at one and half times of the total production cost notwithstanding the farming community is not happy with the budget and feel most of their aspirations have not been touched in the budget. The farmers opine that not much has been done to control the agrarian crisis as only fixing MSP is not enough to check farm distress and they have serious doubts about calculating the production cost. There is dire need to fix favourable norms in determining the production cost of crops by including all the aspects associated with farming. The farmers feel that nothing has been done on the biggest crisis the farming is facing that of the mounting debt as the issue has not even touched in the budget. Punjab is hoped to get very small portion of the institutional farm credit raised from Rs. 10 lakh crore to Rs. 11 lakh crore in the budget, claim farmers.The farmers also rues that the government has linked the salaries of members of parliament(MP)to inflation and this has not been felt necessary for famers who are the backbone of the economy. The minimum fixed income for farmers too need to be announced.“We have been demanding fixing of agricultural scientist MS Swaminathan recommendations about adding 50% profit in the production cost while determining the MSP. It should be done by calculating all the expenses incurred in production of crops as most of the small farmers in Punjab get land on lease for farming. The commission for agricultural costs and prices (CACP)calculate the cost without taking in account many factors like the cost of lease of land which is calculated very less which is far from ground realities. In Punjab lease money is over Rs. 40,000 per acre but it is calculated at nearly Rs. 15,000. Like wise many other expenses =as hiring farm machinery are not calculated as per prevailing market rates”, said farm organisation BKU Ekta Ugrahan general secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokri. He said the budget has untouched many othe factors like subsidy on fertilisers, putting GST on tractors apart from debt waive. Jaitley claim that MSP has been made 1.5 times on Rabi crops but here cost of production of wheat in last season was worked out at Rs. 1800 per quintal and MSP was fixed at Rs. 1625 per quintal.Prof Sukhpal Singh, head of economics and sociology department, Punjab Agriculture University said that “if all the costs including rent of land, fixed cost, family labour is calculated while fixing MSP only then farmers could be benefitted but normally variable cost is taken into account wherein fixed cost is not calculated. IN such case famers will not get any benefit”.“Punjab farmers are under debt of more than R. 70,000 crore, which is leading small farmers in committing suicides. Punjab farmers contributed maximum in masking country self reliant in food grains and now when it is turn of governments in raking care of the farm loans the budget is completely silent on it. After Punjab government deceived the farmers on loan waiver we were hoping that union government may provide respite but nothing has been done on the count”, said farmer organisation BKU Dakonda president Buta Singh Burjgill.Finance Minister Arun Jaitley with a broad smile has linked the salaries of MPs with price index or inflation but has done nothing to fix any minimum earning of famers as our crops are prone to natural calamities and in such cases very small compensation is given, said Krantikari kisan union president Surjit Singh Phool.There is not much scope in food processing in Punjab as doubling of allocation to Rs. 14,000 crore will not provide any benefit to Punjab farmers and government should suggest other measures to supplement farm income, said farmer Avtar Singh.',\n",

With no direct benefit to the industry and hike of 1% cess on income tax and introduction of 10% long-term capital gain (LTCG) tax, the businessmen are disappointed.They say there is nothing for small industry and the BJP government has failed to live up to their expectations and failed miserably to address their issues.At an interactive session organized by the Chamber of Industrial and Commercial Undertakings (CICU) on Thursday, in which the Budget was streamed live, majority of businessmen expressed their resentment over the FM totally ignoring the MSME sector. The businessmen, however, are hopeful that perks and benefits to the agriculture sector will indirectly benefit them as well.Upkar Singh Ahuja, CICU president, says, “There is neither anything for the MSME sector nor the exporters. It is disappointing as we were expecting a lot from the government, but not a single suggestion of ours was considered by the finance minister. The Budget could have been better.”Jaspal Singh, a bicycle parts’ manufacturer and exporter, says, “This is a very disappointing Budget. We have not been given a single benefit. What is even more shocking is that the government has put a burden on us by increasing cess on income tax by 1% and also introduced 10% LTCG tax. If they did not have to give us anything, they could have at least refrained from hiking cess and imposing a new tax.”Some taxation experts termed the Budget as positive. Ashok Juneja, president of Punjab Tax Bar Association (PTBA), says, “We must appreciate the fact that the government has tried its best to reduce fiscal deficit by not announcing populist measures. Also, the steps to improve the living standards of the common man and the poor with free gas and power connections and housing for poor should be appreciated, as these will make India a developed nation.”“Once again, the Union government has disappointed us as no relief has been given as far as direct taxes are concerned. We were expecting enhancement in income tax exemption limit, but nothing has been done. On the contrary, extra burden of tax payment has been imposed on us in the form of increase in cess on income tax from 3% to 4%. The government wants to benefit corporates and lure farmers ahead of elections. It is a big disappointment for MSME sector. We feel that we should shut down our factories and start cultivation,” said Narinder Bhamra, president of Fasteners Manufacturers’ Association of India (FMAI).Ahuja adds, “I will give 50 of 100 to this Budget as it has nothing for the industry, especially MSME. The only thing positive about it is that the finance minister has taken steps for the progress of agriculture sector that will indirectly benefit the industry.”Meanwhile, capital market experts, too, have given a thumbs up to the Budget, saying the panic in share market was temporary and regardless of the new LTCG tax, investors will not refrain from investing in shares.Harjit Singh Arora of Master Trust, an equity trading company, says, “All important sectors have been covered.

In addition, horse races too are not being held this year due to the ‘Glanders’ virus.On the inaugural day of the 82nd edition of Kila Raipur Games, dog race remained the centre of attraction among spectators and festival lovers. For the past several days, the dog race was not given a clearance by the National Welfare Board, but finally on Friday morning, the local administration gave a green signal to the organizing committee to host the race in this session of the games, as the event is already hit by a lack of interest among many of the old spectators.The games commenced with a hockey match, while different races and traditional events were running parallel to hockey.A few elder people claimed the festival would not survive in the future, as Kila Raipur had made its name only due to bullock cart and horse races.“Despite the fact that Jallikattu had re-started in Tamil Nadu, this year too Kila Raipur Sports Association members failed to bring back the animal races. Besides, the organizers have not brought anything new to the festival, after the ban on bullock cart race by the apex court. Farmers claimed that festival organizers should put in special efforts to uplift the event, as a large number of foreigners come every year, but this year only a few arrived,” said a spectator, Gurjinder Singh. According to estimates, there were only 700-800 spectators on the first day of the games, which earlier — during the bullock cart races — used to witness at least a 3,000-strong crowd.Jagbir Singh Garewal, a core committee member of the Kila Raipur Sports Association simply said: “We will try our best to bring back the bullock cart races next year.”',\n",

The Finance Minister’s announcement for spending 20 billion for developing agriculture market and the announcement of MSP are some of the initiatives wich experts feel would go a long way in giving an impetus to the farming. Their representatives however caution that the government will have to implement the measures in latter and spirit.SS Johal, Agriculture expert said, “It is a good budget for agriculture and farmers. The Finance Minister has announced Minimum Support Price (MSP) 1.5 times the cost of produce for farmers. Though it would help the large scale farmers and not the small ones but still it is good. Besides the E-market and food parks are really good initiative. The plan of spending Rs 20 billion for developing agricultural market and Grameen Agriculture market in which the farmers would sell directly to buyers – both are appreciable steps.”The Vice Chancellor of Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) Baldev Singh Dhillon, “It is a very good budget for agriculture and farmers. In this years’ budget the government is working to get farmers better price for their products. The increase in MSP, investment of Rs 14 billion to food processing industry, promotion of agricultural export, developing agricultural markets are defiantly beneficial.”Jitender Singh Sandhu a local agriculturist, who is part of a project run by Sarabah Nagar Gurdwara against farmers’ sucide said overall the measures like MSP and more credit to farmers have been good initiatives which would help farmers. “But the measures should be implemented on the ground. In fact it’s high time the governmen realised that the debt waiver to farmers is no no solution and it only works as patch work. Permanent solution needs to be looked into so as to make farming more profitable.Manjit Singh Kang former VC PAU said that the union goverment’s intention of implmenting recommendations of Swaminathan commission report, which stresses that the farmers should gain 50% over the input cost, can prove to be a game changer. “This once implemented would ensure that the farmers survive and the sector starts witnessing growth,” he said.',\n",

       " 'Ludhiana: The careless attitude of Ludhiana MC officials is solely responsible for the civic body’s poor financial condition. This was revealed through the Right to Information (RTI) Act, as civic officials did not recover pending dues from commercial complexes even after several years, except when the matter came to the light of the Punjab and Haryana high court. According to information revealed on Monday, MC is yet to recover Rs 6.83 crore in the form of assessment fee from these commercial complexes.City-based RTI activist Rohit Sabharwal had filed a complaint, and a contempt petition in HC against 86 commercial complexes, where even parking spaces in the basement were being utilized for commercial purposes. Though MC had conducted a sealing exercise, they regularized 34 complexes, saying they were constructed before 1997. Even if the complexes were constructed before 1997, MC should have recovered the assessed amount from them before regularization. But till date, MC has not served notices to the complexes. Sabhawal inquired about it in the RTI query, and MC officials admitted that they had yet to recover the dues from them.Sabharwal said if officials had paid attention, they could have recovered the amount several years ago, but even now, they were assessing the challans when he filed a contempt petition in the HC. He added that MC officials had submitted an affidavit in the HC that these complexes could be regularized after payment of a fee (called compounding), as they were constructed before 1997. Meanwhile, MC commissioner Jaskiran Singh feigned ignorance about the recovery status, and said he would get the status checked from the staff concerned, and if recovery had not yet started, he would ask them to do it as soon as possible.Notably, Sabharwal had initially filed a writ petition in HC against the commercial complexes for not providing parking in the basement, but when MC officials did not take action, then he filed a contempt petition. Last summer, the HC had even summoned the then principal secretary of Local Bodies, Satish Chandra, who had then formed committees, which conducted a survey of 86 such complexes in the city. These committees too admitted that commercial complexes and many establishments were using their basements for purposes other than parking, and MC had sealed these buildings.',\n",

That the government schools do not even have basic infrastructure became apparent recently when several private school associations opposed the move of the Punjab government to end the self-centre system. Different associations in Punjab are opposing it strongly, fearing their students would not get even the basic facilities of desks, washrooms, and clean water in government schools. Besides, commuting to distant examination centres would be another concern for the students.The education department has decided to end the self-centre system this year, in which students of a school used to appear for exams in their own schools. Now, the department has decided to make government schools the centres for private schools in order to curb cheating during exams. However, the decision has not gone down well with different associations of private schools, and therefore, they are writing to the Punjab School Education Board (PSEB) and education minister Aruna Chaudhary, besides approaching different MLAs and ministers to oppose the decision.The state general secretary of Recognized and Affiliated Schools’ Association (Rasa), Kulwant Rai Sharma, said: “I appreciate the department’s efforts to curb cheating in exams. However, before changing examination centres, it should have talked to associations to know the problems at the ground level. The centres for private school students will be made in government schools, ignoring the fact that several schools do not have sufficient benches, separate washrooms for girls and boys, and clean drinking water facilities. We do not want our students to write exams sitting on mats. Today, I have written to the education minister and PSEB about the issue, asking them to either ensure proper facilities for students, or not to change their centres, otherwise the association will agitate against it.”The president of Association of PSEB Affiliated Schools (Punjab), Rajinder Sharma, said: “Arranging transportation for students will be such a difficult task, and asking them to reach the examination centres on their own will not be safe at all. The department should rethink the decision for the convenience of students.”',\n",

Rakesh Jain — a businessman from BRS Nagar who frequently travels to Delhi to meet his parents — said: “The decision not to run more special trains in the Northern Railways route has disappointed us a little, but the keen steps towards safety and betterment of passengers bring happiness on the faces of commuters.”“Ludhiana will be developed as a word-class station in which escalators and lifts are installed for the convenience of passengers. Proper cleanliness would be maintained to overcome the issue of foul smell emanating from railway tracks. This is one of the best decisions the ministry has made in its budget for railways on Thursday,” stated Ankit Kapoor, a professor in a city college. He added: “Railway crossings across Ludhiana and Ferozepur divisions would soon be digitalized, as the railway budget has cleared the decision, and soon it will be implemented, so that accidents will come down to some extent.”Installing CCTVs cameras in all major long route trains is a decision hailed by most women, as the safety of women in late night hours has become a major issue for female commuters. Soon, escalators will be installed in the Ludhiana railway station, as the minister has proposed this in the railway budget. “Despite the fact that the central government has made ramps at public places mandatory for the benefit of physically challenged commuters, the Ludhiana railway station does not have any ramps at any place. But now, these would have to be constructed at the station, as in the budget, they have ordered its installation at the earliest at all model railway stations — including Ludhiana — across India,” said Sanjeev Sharma, a shopkeeper in the old city.',\n",

South Africa were 122-4 at that stage, with leftarm chinaman Yadav bowling from one end and Yazuvendra Chahal - armed with his leg-break googlies - at the other.ALSO READ: First match win will give us momentum, says KohliIndia had clearly read the pitch well, opting for another spinner, a right-arm off-break, in Kedar Jadhav to go along with wrist spinners Yadav and Chahal.In the last six months, bowling coach Bharat Arun has identified bowling resources and started planning a broader picture for the team\\'s attack: classic finger spin would assist a battery of quality pacers in the five-day format while wrist spin would be India\\'s primary weapon in One-dayers and T20s.The general idea has been to assume that there will be little assistance from the pitches, and plan accordingly.First, India began to focus on identifying unorthodox slow bowlers. \"Yadav, for example, is a great option. He\\'s still young and has a long way to go. But a fine prospect,\" Arun said.The likes of Kuldeep and Chahal have stood out because they taken their chances in the middle. Flighting the ball, going after wickets, ringing in premediated changes - they\\'re ready to try it all. And then there\\'s Kedar Jadhav, always an option on slow wickets. The slower the wicket gets, the more unplayable Jadhav becomes, simply because his ball just doesn\\'t come on to the bat.His dismissal of Jimmy Neesham and Tom Latham around three months ago in the ODIs between India and New Zealand brought him into immediate focus. With an action described as \\'funny\\', Jadhav bowling is anything but.It is the kind of attack India want to build given the World Cup is only 16 months away.Outside of the XI that walked out on Thursday, there was left-arm orthodox spinner Axar Patel warming the bench. In fact India have close to 11bowling options from the squad of 15 they\\'ve flown to South Africa with. That\\'s quite an arsenal to bank on.',\n",
       " 'NOIDA: The viscera report of a Greater Noida student, whose mysterious death last year had triggered attacks on some Nigerian nationals over allegations that they had drugged him, has found no traces of drugs in his body.Police in Kasna, who received the medical report recently, said the charges against five Nigerians booked earlier would be dropped and their passports returned.“The viscera report came recently. The cause of death is — ‘NIL’. It does not state any drug overdose or poison,” said BK Verma, the SHO of Kasna police station.Manish Khari, a Class XII student, had been reported missing on March 25 last year. The next day, he was found in a trance-like state outside his house in Sector Pie 2 and died later in hospital. His family had alleged that some Nigerian students staying in the neighbourhood had drugged him, causing his death.A candlelight march in Manish’s memory had turned violent and several African nationals were assaulted in Ansal Plaza Mall and Pari Chowk in Greater Noida. External affairs minister Sushma Swaraj had ordered a probe into the matter.Five persons were arrested and five Nigerians detained for questioning were later released for lack of evidence. Manish’s post-mortem report had stated the cause of death as “unknown” and his viscera were sent for an examination.Zakiyyu Muhammad, senior public prosecutor representing the Nigerian government and the general secretary of the Nigeria Citizens’ Welfare Association, said: “We love India. But we are being treated as second-class citizens. People had levelled allegations of cannibalism against us. It is a lie. We need an open and welcoming India.”',\n",

In the meantime, we will take the message to the people as to how AP was completely ignored in the Budget,” was Naidu’s message to TDP leaders. Sources said several ministers and MPs told Naidu that the “injustice” can be answered only by severing ties with BJP. “However, Naidu advocated restrain for the time being and suggested that they wait for the Budget session to end before taking any decision.However, by the evening, he convened meetings on Friday and on Sunday as the disappointment over the treatment meted out to AP in the Budget was wide and deep,” said sources.In the evening, Naidu met ministers and pointed out the railway projects sanctioned for Maharashtra. “It is very disappointing,” he is said to have remarked.“If this is the situation, we will have to rethink the alliance,” said spokesperson Jupudi Prabhakar Rao.“The CM is unhappy. We expected funds for AP but the Budget ignored the revenue deficit state and instead favoured developed cities like Mumbai and Bengaluru,” said agriculture minister Somireddi Chandramohan Reddy.',\n",

       " 'HYDERABAD: The first day of February turned out to be the coldest day in the city in the last six years, with the minimum temperature dropping to 12.8 degree Celsius on Thursday, the lowest after 2011.According to Indian Meteorological Department, Hyderabad, the mean temperature during February is 18.3 degree Celsius for minimum temperature and 32.4 degree Celsius for maximum temperature.While the minimum temperature saw a departure of four degrees from the normal, IMD did not issue any cold wave warning. Cold wave conditions are announced only when the temperature drops by five degrees below normal for that time of winter.For the past six years, the lowest minimum temperature recorded during February hovered between 14 and 17 degree Celsius. It was last on February 5, 2011, that the mercury levels plummeted to 12.8 degree Celsius. The all-time record for February stands at 8.9 degree Celsius in 1911.Experts attribute the sudden drop in mercury levels to cold winds blowing from the easterly and north easterly region over Telangana.Meanwhile, the northern districts of Telangana were under the grip of cold wave. The IMD issued a severe cold wave warning. \"Severe cold wave conditions prevailed at isolated places in Khammam and cold wave conditions prevailed at isolated places in Adilabad and Medak,\" read the weather report issued on Thursday. Private weather forecasting agencies have predicted rise in mercury levels by next week.',\n",

       " 'CHARMINAR: Stashed in a garbage dump and away from prying eyes in Aliabad, an ancient cannon was discovered by children, who stumbled upon it on Thursday.The cannon was found next to a discarded car with garbage strewn around it near a fortified wall built by past rulers to provide security.Historians said it was used during wars to fire heavy projectiles. One of the residents told the authorities that there are a few more in the area and all of them need to be preserved in a museum.\"The area is full of ancient monuments, tombs, war memorials and artillery. The officials do not take any interest in protecting them,\" said Shamsheer Ali, a resident.In March 2016, another cannon was found during a digging work to widen the Hussaini Alam road near Charminar. \"These are very interesting finds and the government should make sure they are well protected for future generations,\" said Anuradha Reddy, co-convener of the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage.\"We will verify but the cannons that are outside the limits of the museums are not under our maintenance,\" N R Visalatchy, director of the State Archaeology and Museums Department, said.',\n",
       " 'Union finance minister Arun Jaitley during his budget speech on Thursday announced that modern train sets with state -of-the-art amenities and features were being designed at the Integral Coach Factory (ICF) in Perambur, Chennai. The first such train-set would be commissioned in 2018-19.As reported by TOI a week ago, this will be a semihigh speed self-propelled train which will come without engines and cut down travel time by at least 20% compared to other trains. This is because of faster acceleration and deceleration, said ICF officials.The 16-coach fully airconditioned train is slated to hit the tracks by June 2018, said officials. The maximum speed it will be able to run at will be 160kmph.The new train with an aerodynamic nose for reduced drag and for improved aesthetics is likely to replace the elite Shatabdi trains now used for superfast inter-city travel, said ICF officials.The train sets (like EMUs) will have continuous window glasses for a contemporary modern look and automatic plug-type’ sliding doors which will open and close automatically at the stations. Zero discharge vacuum-based bio-toilet is the other highlight for this train.</div><br/></div><div class=\"zB_L9\" data-bottomsocialshare=\"62749992\"><div class=\"\"><div class=\"_1Pa3q _2_Ixx _3JS6q

       " 'RAJKOT: Fishermen in Gujarat can expect to get cheaper loans easily with finance minister Arun Jaitley extending the Kisan credit card facility to fishing and animal husbandry.For long, the fishing community seeking working capital has been exploited by traders who don’t just charge them high interest rates but also give them loans on a pre-condition that they would sell their fish catch to them for less than the market price.For example, a group of 10 fishermen go into deep sea to get a good catch. The trip lasts from 10 days to one month depending on the size of the fishing boat and they incur expenses for food and fuel. The minimum diesel requirement for a single trip is around Rs 1.5 to Rs 2 lakh. They have to stock food and other necessary items for survival in the sea. They also have to arrange for ice to keep fish stock fresh and need good quality nets which need maintenance. For all this, the group needs working capital before going into sea. Currently, there is no formal channel from where they can get credit. Even banks don’t provide them loans for the fishing activity like farmers get for crops.According to the prevailing tradition, they take advance money from a fish traders for use as working capital in exchange of promise to sell him the whole catch of the trip. Many traders exploit them and pay Rs 10 to Rs 15 per kg less than market price, which results in big loss for fishermen.Bharat Modi, Porbandar Fishermen Association, said, “According to rough estimates, fishermen end up paying additional Rs 25,000 over the interest on say a Rs 3 lakh loan. The kisan credit card will help fishermen get money for working capital easily. Diesel is the main expense and fishermen will be able to buy fuel using this credit card.”Tulsi Gohil, president of Veraval Boat Association said, “At present, none of the banks provide us working capital and traders and suppliers exploit us. If fishermen actually become beneficiaries of the kisan credit card, we won’t have to pay more to traders. We will be able to sell to those traders from whom we will get competitive rate and this will increase our income.”Velji Masani, chairman of Gujarat Fisheries Central Cooperative Association Ltd (GFCCAL), said, “Extending kisan credit card to fishermen is the biggest provision in this budget to boost fisheries. This will change the life of a fisherman as he will be able to get cheap loans from government banks. He will also have enough cash to maintain the fishing vessels during four off-season months in monsoon.”Though kisan credit card has been largely welcomed, one long-pending demand of the community has not been addressed. Gopal Fofandi, president of Akhil Machimar Mahamandal, said, “We had demanded the right to do farming just like farmers as an alternative source of income during off-season. Farmers come into our profession after taking a crop as there is no restriction. But we can’t do farming.”',\n",

       " 'BHOPAL: In a heart-wrenching incident, a toddler was mauled to death by eight-to-10 stray dogs less than 50 feet away from his house in a densely populated area of the capital on Thursday morning.The two-year-old child was playing near his house in Dhar Gali in Gautam Nagar locality when the pack of dogs attacked him and dragged him into a nullah. By the time a neighbour spotted the horror and shooed away the dogs, the baby was bitten over 250 times. The injured boy was rushed to hospital where doctors declared him brought dead.The kin and local residents alleged that there are more than 200 stray dogs in the locality which attack children and passer bys on a regular basis. Complaints to Bhopal Municipal Corporation (BMC) have failed to get any positive results.SHO Gautam Nagar police station Mukhtar Qureshi said that dead boy was identified as Sheikh Raza, son of Sheikh Imran, a resident of Dhar Gali in Krishna Colony near PGBT College. His father Sheikh Imran runs a business of sharpening the knives. Sheikh Imran has another child Sana, 3 who is elder to Raza..Grandfather of the deceased kid Sheikh Abbas told police that Sheikh Raza was playing near the house after having tea in the morning. While playing in the narrow lanes he went near the nullah.There were some stray dogs sitting on a heap of garbage beside the nullah and one of the dogs barked on Raza and the others suddenly attacked him. They grabbed his leg and dragged him in to the dry nullah. The boy cried for help but nobody was present. He received severe wounds on his abdomen and face.A neighbour Abdul Rafiq Khan, looked through the window hearing the boy’s cries and spotted the dogs attacking the boy and rushed to rescue him. He struggled to shoo away the dogs and then called the Raza’s family members. The kin and locals rushed Raza to Kamla Nehru hospital in critical condition where the doctors declared him brought dead.SHO Qureshi said that soon after getting information about the incident senior police officers including ASP (Zone-III) Rajesh Singh Bhadouria, CSP Hanumanganj Gladwin Carr along with SDM Bairagarh Pradeep Sharma and local MLA Arif Aqueel reached the spot and met the family members of the deceased. The locals and family members complained about the lax attitude of BMC officials to the officers and MLA Aqeel for not taking action on stray dog menace in the area despite several complaints.Another resident Munne Khan said, “We have made several complaints with BMC officials, but no action has been taken so far.” SHO Qureshi said that SDM Sharma announced an ex-gratia relief of Rs 10,000 to be given to the grieved family.',\n",
       " 'AHMEDABAD/RAJKOT/VADODARA: Acknowledging the importance of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) as growth drivers and employment generators, finance minister Arun Jaitley laid a major thrust of these units in the Budget 2018-19.Industry bodies have welcomed extending the reduced corporate tax of 25% for MSMEs having a turnover up to Rs 250 crore and said that this would create more jobs and generate more income.Jaitley also allocated Rs 3,794 crore for credit support, capital and interest subsidy for the MSMEs.“Working capital is a major issue for MSMEs, which were adversely impacted by the cascading effect of demonetization and implementation of Goods and Services Tax (GST). Credit support, capital and interest subsidy will enable greater financing at a lower interest to MSMEs. This will ease cashflow issues to a great extent,” said Shailesh Patwari, president, Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industries (GCCI).Industry associations also hailed a cut in corporate tax. “More than 50% MSMEs in Saurashtra will be covered under the reduced slab. It is a major step and industrial sectors in Saurashtra including machine tools, plastic and auto parts engineering, among others will be benefited,” Jaman Bhalan, president, Metoda GIDC, an industrial estate near Rajkot.There are some 65,000 MSME units in Saurashtra dealing in auto parts, agriculture machinery, diesel engines, submersible pump, machine tools, brass parts, pharmaceuticals, textile, engineering, ceramics and sanitary ware, among others.Similarly, even the central Gujarat region is also home to several engineering and pharmaceutical MSMEs. Federation of Gujarat Industries (FGI) president, Nitin Mankad, said, “The government has taken a positive step for the growth of MSMEs. If the government works further for ease of doing business, it will boost industrial growth.”“The budget has made provisions to revamp online loan sanctioning facility for MSMEs to prompt decision making by the banks. In addition, tax relief to MSMEs with a 5% reduction in corporate tax is commendable and likely to push private capex,” said Rajiv Vastupal, chairman, FICCI.',\n",

He said that the new system was the second milestone in the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime. This is the single bill applicable for the entire country.However, later in the evening, there were reports that the e-waybill system experienced technical glitches leading to the deferment of the introduction of the system from Thursday. When asked about it, Kumar told TOI: \"We are not aware of any technical glitches. The e-waybill system has been launched and if we face any technical glitches, we will revert to the old system till they are rectified.\"Addressing a press conference on Thursday, he said that the new system would help the state government access a database that would monitor the movement of goods from one state to another. He added that e-waybill becomes mandatory for transport of taxable goods exceeding a value of Rs 50,000. It is also mandatory for goods sent for job work from one state to another, irrespective of the value of the consignment transported.Kumar termed January 2018 as the best month post-GST. \"While the state government got Rs 1,493 crore in December 2017, it has earned Rs 1,656 crore in January 2018,\" he said.He also said that 14,000 notices were served on traders who did not file their GST returns and Rs 1.19 crore collected as penalty.

       " \"NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli peeled off yet another century as India defeated South Africa by six wickets in the first ODI of the six-match series to take 1-0 lead at Kingsmead, Durban on Thursday. India chased down 270 in 45.3 overs thanks to a measured century from Kohli, his first limited-overs ton in South Africa, who was out after scoring 112 off 119.ALSO READ: First match win will give us momentum: KohliIt was India's first ever win in ODIs over South Africa in Durban and in the process they also broke the hosts' run of 17 consecutive wins at home.Ajinkya Rahane also played a solid knock, scoring 79 – his fifth straight half-century in ODIs, equalling the Indian record jointly held by Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid and Virat Kohli [twice].1ST ODI: AS IT HAPPENEDIndia began on a positive note but both openers Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan were out after getting starts. Rohit miscued a shot on 20 to be caught by 'keeper Quinton de Kock off Morne Morkel. His partner Dhawan cut an angry figure sitting in the Indian dressing room after being run out on 35.Kohli called for a non-existent single in the 13th over of Indian chase as Dhawan inside edged one onto his pads. However, before he could react, Kohli was halfway down the pitch and Aiden Markram's direct hit caught Dhawan well short of the crease at the non-striker's end.India were 67/2 when Kohli and Rahane joined hands and together they steered the India innings in the forward direction. The duo added a record 189 runs for the third wicket before being separated in the 43rd over when Rahane, aiming to finish the game early, ended up being caught at long-on. His innings had five fours and two sixes.Kohli departed two overs later but not before he had played a thoroughly entertaining knock studded with 10 fours. He reached the three-figure mark with a four and celebrated his 33rd ODI ton animatedly – in his own inimitable style. MS Dhoni finished the chase in style with a four as India won with over four overs to spare and six wickets remaining.Earlier, Faf du Plessis scored his ninth century as South Africa recovered to post a competitive 269/8. India spinners applied the brakes in the middle overs to reduce South Africa to 134/5 at one stage before captain Du Plessis (120) led the recovery. He was involved in the two highest partnerships of the South Africa innings. He first added 53 runs for the second wicket with Quinton de Kock (34) after Jasprit Bumrah gave India an early breakthrough in Hashim Amla (16).The Indian spinners did well to never allow the South African top-order to settle after the hosts opted to bat with Yuzvendra Chahal and Kuldeep Yadav keeping the pressure on their batsmen by bowling tight overs. Between them, the middle-order trio of Markram, JP Duminy and the big-hitting David Miller could only manage 28 runs as South Africa continued to slip. Du Plessis, though, continued to bat solidly and finally found an able ally in allrounder Chris Morris who scored a handy 37 before becoming Kuldeep's third victim who eventually finished with 3/34.On the other hand legspinner Chahal returned figures of 2/45 with Bumrah (1/56) and Bhuvneshwar Kumar (1/71) chipping in with a wicket each.Du Plessis struck 11 fours and two sixes during his knock and finally holed out in the last over of the South Africa innings to Hardik Pandya off Bhuvneshwar. However, India were simply too good for them on Thursday night with Kohli recording his 18th century in successful chases.Brief Scores: India 270/4 (Virat Kohli 112, Ajinkya Rahane 79) beat South Africa 269/8 (Faf du Plessis 120; Kuldeep Yadav 3/34) by six wicketsWATCHVirat Kohli hits another ODI century, India thrash South Africa by six wickets\",\n",

       " 'Before you buy that residential property, brush up on your home economicsTax benefits on principalEquated monthly instalments (EMIs) are typically divided into principal (the amount you took as loan) and interest (the cost of servicing the loan). Principal is allowed as a deduction from your gross total income (subject to an overall cap with other eligible investments of 1.5 lakh)Union Budget 2018: Complete CoverageTax benefits on interest paidInterest payable on ‘self-occupied’ property is subject to a maximum deduction of 2 lakh under the head ‘Income from House Property’. This reduces your total tax liability. But to claim this, acquisition or construction should be completed within 5 years from the end of the financial year in which the loan was taken. If not, the deduction will be limited to 30,000.Additional deduction of 50,000 is allowed for first-time home buyers if certain conditions are fulfilled If you have rented out your property, the difference between the rent you get after adjustment of municipal taxes, standard deduction and interest on housing loan is your ‘loss’. For example, if the annual rent is 5 lakh, after considering standard deduction @30% of gross value (which is generally rent), 3.5 lakh is your loss. As per Finance Act 2017 amendment, you can set off only 2 lakh of such loss against your other income, say salary. The balance (surplus loss of 1.5 lakh), can be carried forward over eight years. However, it can only be set off against your rental incomeWhy not to go alone on a home loan, and other useful pointers1. It makes tax sense to purchase the new apartment jointly – say with your spouse, then both of you are entitled to a deduction of 2 lakh each for interest. In case you have a working son/daughter and the bank is willing to split the loan three ways, all three can avail deduction up to 2 lakh each on self- occupied property2. A ready-to-move flat could cost more. Booking an under-construction flat may work out cheaper as I-T laws permit you to claim the total interest paid during the predelivery period as a deduction in five equal instalments starting from the financial year in which the construction was completed or you acquired your apartment (generally this denotes the date of possession). Of course, the maximum you can claim as a deduction per year continues to be 2 lakh, in case of self-occupied property3. Interest on a loan taken from an employer, friend, or even private lender is eligible for deduction, but you should obtain a certificate from the lender. Note that principal repayment is not eligible for deduction under 80C4. Expense incurred towards repair and maintenance are not allowed as a deduction from income from house property. However, a standard deduction @ 30% of gross value (which is generally the rent received) is allowed to compensate for repair and maintenance expenses of a let-out house property. Also, municipal taxes paid during the financial year is allowed as a deduction5. It’s best to rent out your second home from an I-T perspective. If you have not let it out, it will still attract tax on its expected market rent (known as deemed value). It’s better to pay tax on rent which you actually earnWATCHFM Arun Jaitley announces reduced corporate tax rate in budget 2018',\n",
       " 'The Union budget has set a target to enhance the capacity of 124 airports under the AAI to one billion trips per year and, to begin with, has allocated ₹60crore for the initiative.However, there is no specific announcement on development deadline for Chennai airport, one of the two major airports with AAI.The capacity of the airport is 20 million passengers per year and the airport will miss the bus even though the proposed Phase-II expansion is done and the second airport built to reach an annual passenger capacity on a par with international hubs like Dubai or Singapore.AAI has started paperwork to start the Phase-II expansion — building an integrated terminal, straightening of a taxiway, a satellite terminal, building rapid exit taxiways — to increase the capacity of the airport to 30million passenges per year. But it is already delayed. Building a second airport too may not help because the Union ministry of civil aviation is only looking at, due to constraints on availability of land, a small singlerunway facility where only international operations will be handled. This, too, may not come up in the next five to seven years going by the current pace of work.Nevertheless, passenger and aircraft numbers are increasing at the airport. There has been an 11% increase in passenger numbers and 2.4% rise in aircraft movement from April to December 2017 period compared to the corresponding period last year.A senior AAI official said the airport had lost a lot of time due to lack of clarity over the direction needed to be taken to develop the airport. “There was a plan to privatise it. Then the new government wanted AAI to develop it. More than 10 years have been lost in this uncertainty. Things are moving to speed up the phase-II development only in the last one year,” he added.Amitabh Khosla, country director, India, International Air Transport Association (IATA) said, “We welcome the focus on airport infrastructure capacity announced in the budget. In our 20-year passenger forecasts, IATA anticipates India will become the 3rd largest aviation market by 2024. But this is by no means guaranteed. To make this a reality, airport capacity in India needs to be augmented and expanded quickly. IATA has earlier recommended and is supportive of levaraging AAI’s balance sheet for infrastructure creation and expansion.”Airlines and those in the travel trade sector are worried about the many capacity constraints and congestion at major airports. IATA said in a statement that “the big question mark on capacity, and a critical area of concern for IATA , continues to be about Mumbai airport. Navi Mumbai airport is still a distant dream. In the meantime, Mumbai continues to fall behind in aviation activity.”Sharat Dhall, COO of Yatra.com said that the airport capacity enhancement would help boost tourist flows and strengthen connectivity to a large extent. “The proposal of generating 1 billion trips a year is a welcome move for the travel & tourism sector,” he said.',\n",

       " 'With the Centre approving its ambitious Bharatmala Pariyojana’s phase I recently, as indicated by finance minister Arun Jaitley, to develop about 35,000km in the country, the National Highways Authority of India is all set to implement the high-cost project in five corridors in the state. The central agency recently urged the state highways department to transfer the assets of these existing two-lane highways and provide no objection certificate at the earliest.The Narendra Modi government’s pet project, aimed at providing seamless connectivity of interior and backward areas and borders of the country, is estimated to cost ₹5.35 lakh crore. Government sources said the project, which envisages linking port terminals to the hinterland, will be taken up on an 800km stretch from Vellakoil to Sankakiri via Erode, Musiri to Meikalnaikanpatty near Namakkal, Madurai to Natham, Puttur (Andhra Pradesh) to Janappachatram in Tamil Nadu, Chengalpet to Tuticorin via Nagapattinam and Ramanathapuram bypass. The NHAI requested the state highways department on January 11, to expedite the transfer on a priority basis. The links will have a positive impact on the Logistics Performance Index (LPI) of the country.The corridors identified in the state are crucial links for the economy. “The NHAI has notified new NH numbers for all these stretches. It is likely these highways would be transferred within a fortnight. Their strengthening and widening will be done after land acquisition,” said a government official. The project also figured during the talks that Union road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari had held with chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami recently in Chennai. A day after the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by Modi approved phase I of the scheme in October, the minister expressed hope of launching the highway construction before the end of this year.A government report says the new programme focuses on optimising the efficiency of road traffic movement across the country by bridging critical infrastructure gaps. Identification of the project stretches under the components of the scheme has been done based on detailed study, freight flow projects and verification of the identified infrastructure gaps through geo mapping, using data from Bhaskaracharya Institute for Space Applications and Geo-Informatics as well as from other sources.',\n",
       " 'The budget may have little for the salaried class, but it has offered monetary and medical relief for a section of the retired.Tamil Nadu has the second highest percentage of senior citizens in the country, next to Kerala. The first in a series of concessions provided for the greying population is the exemption of interest income on deposits with banks and post offices being increased from ₹10,000 to ₹50,000. This benefit will also be available for interest from all fixed and recurring deposit schemes. Any interest income earned on the money kept in savings bank accounts above a certain limit is subject to tax.“This is a big boon for senior citizens, as a sizeable percentage of them keep most of their savings, retirement money, pension and gratuity in savings accounts,” said Giridharan R, a chartered accountant. This comes at a time when the interest rates on deposits have been coming down over the last couple of years. “Demonetisation too hit this population as many used to keep cash at home,” he said.Senior citizens will also be able to claim benefit of deduction up to ₹50,000 per annum in respect of any health insurance premium or general medical expenditure incurred. This is significant as the number of people suffering from chronic ailments in the state is double than those in the rest of the country, according to a recent report compiled by IIT-Madras, based on the National Sample Survey. More than one-third of people above 60 are reported to be suffering from chronic ailments.Geriatric physician Dr V S Natarajan, however, is sceptical about the benefits of the budget announcements. “Even among middle-class patients who come to me, less than 20% have medical insurance. This is only going to benefit a niche section– those who pay tax and those who have insurance,” he said.Finance minister Arun Jaitley said the concessions will give extra tax benefit of ₹4,000 crore to senior citizens.The budget also didn’t have much for senior citizens from the lower socio-economic strata. According to the 2011 census, among the 103 million elderly citizens, 70 million are from the lower strata. “For these people, the finance minister has announced a medical insurance cover. But medical insurance isn’t what they need as much as a pension,” said Mathew Cherian, CEO of HelpAge India.

The bench asked all the advocates to come prepared on Feb 15 for a fullfledged hearing on how effectively this GO was implemented in the last two decades and to examine the rationale behind the pleas for scrapping this GO on the ground that it is impeding development in 84 villages near the lakes.The bench reminded advocates of how Chennai is struggling to return to normalcy after last year's inundation. This was a result of disappearance of 90% of tanks in the city to pave way for a concrete jungle.Replying to a query, HMDA counsel Y Rama Rao told the court that they have no intention of recalling GO 111.

       " 'HYDERABAD: In the first ever relief to an accused in the money laundering cases filed by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in the disproportionate assets case pertaining to YSR Congress president Y S Jaganmohan Reddy, Justice Shameem Akther of the Hyderabad High Court on Thursday restrained the Special ED Court from framing charges against senior IAS officer Aditya Nath Das in the water allocation irregularities allegedly committed to benefit India Cements.The judge also dispensed with the legal requirement for the IAS officer to physically appear before the trial court for each adjournment.The judge gave relief to Das after hearing a plea urging court to quash the case against him. ED counsel P S P Suresh Kumar said that Das, as principal secretary of irrigation department, played an instrumental role in ensuring increased water supply to India Cements from Krishna and Kagna rivers by suppressing similar pleas from other companies.Appearing for the officer, senior counsel T Niranjan Reddy refuted the allegations and said the file was moved by the chief engineer and cleared by the minister and the cabinet. Das was only an intermediary and hence no criminal liability can be fastened to him. The prosecution\\'s charge is that India Cements got undue benefit through water allocation and in lieu of it, the company made investment in Jagan\\'s companies, he said. \"Das was not aware of these investments. Slapping money laundering charges is unfair, particularly when the investigators too could not show any proceeds of crime with him,\" Niranjan said.ED\\'s counsel refuted the argument saying that Section 3 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act fixes responsibility even on those who assist the main accused. Das effectively assisted the main accused, the counsel said. Asked by the bench as to what happens if the CBI court finally chooses to acquit India Cements, Suresh Kumar said the ED case is independent of CBI case. We rely on CBI only to the extent of registration of crime and subsequent proceedings under PMLA have their own course, which is tracking the proceeds of crime. Unlike CBI, which cannot go further without sanction from the authorities to prosecute the accused bureaucrats, ED does not require any such sanction from the authorities, the ED counsel said.',\n",
       " 'VADODRA: The city is set to emerge as human resource hub for the Indian railways.Two key projects including the one for setting up specialised railway university and another to set up institute to train manpower for the high speed railway projects like the prestigious Ahmedabad-Mumbai bullet train project – both first of their kind in the country – found mention in union finance minister Arun Jaitley’s budget speech on Thursday.Earlier, the Ministry of Railways had identified 100 acres land at Piparia in Waghodiya taluka for setting up the railway university.But sources said that to begin with existing premises of the National Academy of Indian Railways (NAIR), Vadodara will be utilised for starting both the projects – the National Rail and Transport University (NRTU) being set up by the ministry and the High Speed Rail Training Institute (HSRTI) being set up by the National High Speed Rail Corporation Limited (NHSRCL) in Vadodara at an estimated cost of Rs 600 crore.“HSRTI is being developed over a land area of five hectares. Construction of the institute has commenced and it will be ready by December 2020. The institute will provide advanced training modules on cutting edge technologies relating to HSR,” said Dhananjay Kumar, PRO of NHSRCL.HSRTI, Vadodara will have all those facilities which are available at HSTI of JR-East Railway Company at Shin Shirakawa in Japan like the driver simulator, signal and telecom equipment, OHE and power supply equipment and sample track among others.“The contracts for construction of sample track and hostel building have already been awarded. For operation and maintenance, NHSRCL will require around 4,000 personnel. Out of these, initially around 350 belonging to various categories of maintenance and operation including drivers will be trained in Japan,” said Kumar.“Some of these trained manpower along with other Japanese experts will be utilised to train the remaining personnel at HSRTI, Vadodara before commissioning of the corridor,” he said, adding that the institute will also serve as a back bone for future development of other high speed corridors in India.NRTU being hailed as an idea inspired by Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi to transform the rail and transport sector towards new India received nod from the union cabinet chaired by the PM in December last.It is being set up as a “Deemed to Be University” under de novo category as per the University Grants Commission (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2016.“We are working towards completing all approvals so that the first academic program can be launched in July this year,” said an official.A not-for-profit company (which will be managing company of the university) under section 8 of the Companies Act, 2013 is being created by the ministry. The company will provide financial and infrastructural support to the university and appoint its chancellor and pro-chancellor. A fully autonomous board of management comprising of professionals and academics will perform its academic and administrative responsibilities. In its full enrolment, NRTU which will be funded by the ministry is expected to have 3,000 full time students.',\n",
       " 'MANGALURU: The BJP has condemned utterances of participants at the Souhardategagi Karnataka human chain formation across the state on January 30 that targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi and RSS leaders, in an event the organizers touted as an \"apolitical\" event. The party also described as unfortunate the move to drag Gandhian H S Doreswamy into this act of criticizing the Prime Minister and saffron organizations at an event organized to commemorate the birthday of slain journalist Gauri Lankesh.State BJP spokesperson Sulochana G K Bhat told reporters on Thursday that media advisor to chief minister Siddaramaiah, Dinesh Amin Mattu, had used the event to indulge in bashing of political opponents, and that the party condemned it. \"The language used by Mattu at an event held to promote communal amity does not augur well for the idea of amity,\" she said. She also criticized the language used by Mattu against senior Congress leader B Janardhan Poojary and RSS leader K Prabhakar Bhat.\"Using a \\'secular\\' comme nt for narrow casteist and political gains is unfortunate,\" Sulochana said. She said discerning voters will see through the political game behind the human chain formation. \"Dinesh Amin Mattu is not the custodian of Sri Kshetra Kudroli or events that transpire there,\" she said, referring to Mattu\\'s criticism of the presence of Prabhakar Bhat, at the launch of Poojary\\'s autobiography.',\n",
       " 'MANGALURU: District Congress Committee (DCC) spokesperson AC Vinayaraj has slammed BJP leaders in Dakshina Kannada for making remarks on a Malaysian student obtaining Aadhaar Card in Mangaluru.Vinayaraj told reporters that even foreign nationals, who are residing in India for more than 182 days in the 12 preceding months, are eligible to apply for Aadhaar Card as per Aadhaar Act 2016. However, BJP leaders have been using Malaysian student\\'s Aadhaar Card a political issue to target Congress, he said.Lashing at Dakshina Kannada MP Nalin Kumar Kateel, Vinayaraj said neither J R Lobo, MLA of Manglauru City South, nor any other Congress leaders, have recommended the authorities to issue Aadhaar Card to Malaysian student.“BJP leaders are trying to malign the Congress government in the state by spreading lies that Congress leaders have recommended the authorities to issue Aadhaar Card to Malaysian student. BJP leaders are not aware of Aadhaar Act 2016, which make provisions to issue Aadhaar Cards to all residents, including foreign nationals, who are staying for more than 182 days in the 12 months preceding the application. Let BJP leaders understand that Aadhaar Cards are being distributed by the central government and not the state government. Let leaders raise the issue in the Parliament, if they have objections in Aadhaar Cards being distributed to foreign nationals. Let them seek amendments to Aadhaar Act 2016 to prevent the issue of Aadhaar Cards to foreign nationals,” Vinayaraj said adding that Aadhaar Card is not a proof of citizenship, but just a proof of identity.Further, he charged BJP leaders of making false allegations against MLA Lobo and the Congress government for political gains. “Assembly election in the state this year will be fought between development of state and lies of BJP.\"',\n",

       " 'Newbie Prakash Alex composes the music for Sravan Mukesh-Varsha Bolamma starrer Kalyanam and the USP of the album is youthful, romance-dripping tunes. They can’t claim much novelty, but have enough peppiness to interest us while they last.The first song is Mazhamukile by Najim Arshad and it refreshes memories of many of his songs, including Medapoopattum Chutti from Karinkunnam Sixes and Kanninnullil… from Trivandrum Lodge. Regardless, it strikes gold right at the beginning. The song moves into a different turf of longingness, from sweet romance, in the second stanza and the transition, back and forth, is interesting. Backing vocals for the portion Kurukkuthi Mulle… by Shyam Nettayikodath sweetens the song further.The immediate next Pande Nee by Siddharth Menon, is similar in tune and arrangement as the first and differs only in rhythm. The song, written by Rajeev Nair, is an interesting listen and an apt day-dreaming device for those teenaged ‘in love for the first time’ boys.Dulquer Salmaan is behind the mike again, this time in company of Gregory Jacob, for the third song Dhritangapulakithan. It seems to be just intended as a fun song about the trouble with ladies and that’s all it turns out to be. The lyric by Linku Abraham that goes Plingippoi Jeevitham is amusing in parts. The song suits the voice of both the actors to a T. Kunjilam Poove in a super-young and tender voice of Nia Pathiala follows. The song, for a change, has a light music feel. Nia’s voice, still developing, portrays the right amount of innocence required for the track.Suchith Suresan wraps up the album with the title track Kalyanam. With a well-balanced Kerala wedding feel and youthfulness, it’s a vibrant song. The tune dances along well in Suchith’s voice, especially in the second stanza. The tune definitely has no freshness as mentioned before, but it’s a fun song.',\n",
